## 2021-01-28T03:16:34.540Z - Goodbye, Friend

This whole time I thought changing the world was something you did. An act you performed, something you fought for, I don’t know if that’s true anymore, or if changing the world was just about being here. By showing up, no matter how many times we get told we don’t belong. By staying true even when we’re shamed into being false. By believing in ourselves, even when we are told we’re too different. And if we all held onto that. If we refused to budge and fall in line. If we stood our ground for long enough, just maybe, the world can’t help but change around us. Even though we’ll be gone, its like Mr Robot said we’ll always be a part of Elliot Alderson. And we’ll be the best part, because we’re the part that always showed up. We’re the part that stayed. We’re the part that changed him. And who wouldn’t be proud of that?

10:12 PM The Failure of Time Invention-An Unkindness of Ravens

The Failure of Time Invention-An Unkindness of Ravens This is the intro to the new record, I used holdens speech from the movie "Chasing Amy" because I found it very fitting with how the rest of this record plays out. Why are we stopping? Cause I can't take this. I love you. Can't take what? You love me? I love you. And not, not…

Midnight, graveyard, it begins to rain
The lights flicker than suddenly fade

I can hear you calling out my name
As you stand 6 feet above my grave
4 years later now I am awake
This time I’m here to stay

I am the light at the end of your tunnel
I make right the wrongs you’ve done

I am burning with a love so deep
That no darkness could ever defeat

## 2021-05-08T22:27:47.185Z - Been a long time since I’ve Had Peace Internally and Externally. Thank You Tawnie Nicole Reynolds for Helping Me Achieve what I Thought Was not Possible. You Remind Me of the Vision I Use to Have about Love and Life and what a Relationship is Supposed to Be. We don’t Have much in Common Accept for what We Believe is Right and Wrong and how Things Should Be. The High Standards that the Children Always come First and Our Relationships with Their moms/dads is Encouraged instead of grounds for a Fight. You Give Me the Freedom to Be Me and to Do what I want to Do. We’re Almost 6 Months into This Relationship and We haven’t Had a Single Fight or Gone to Bed Mad. Thank You for Being You

## 2021-05-24T21:11:05.648Z - If You Think You Can or You can’t, you’re Right. Your Mindset is what Gets You where You Are, where You want to Be or where You don’t want to Be. Self Accountability is the Key to Understanding why You Are where You Are. It’s that Simple yet so Hard for Some of Us to Accept. Acknowledge Your Mistakes, Accept that You Have Flaws and Seek out the Lesson to Be Learned, Every time You Fuck Up. Grow through the Pain and Grow with the Rain. You Need the Cloudy Days to Appreciate the Sun. You can’t Get to where You want to Be without First Understanding how to Get there

I Get so Pissed when people’s Anxiety Affects Me Cause it’s Been a Habit for so long that I Turn around and forward that Anxiety onto Those around Me, but I Have Grown to Be Self Aware that I’m Doing It, so I Get Pissed at Myself for Knowing Better.

Rewind time, long before I knew how to write,
And how to use words to form these rhymes
Back to when my father first came into my life
Just a few months back before I had turned five

He took me in as his own
with love and it showed
Me and mom weren’t alone
Now me and her had a home

## 2021-06-22T21:25:05.644Z - It’s not anybody’s Responsibility to Live up to Your Expectations of Them, that Falls under the Category of “Shit You’re Not In Control Of” Jot that down and File that under the “Shit You Need To Realize and Understand” Section of Your Brain.

## 2021-06-23T05:52:59.524Z - Death Is An Open Door

Give me one more day
One more day without the rain
One more day without the pain
Just me and you face to face
I swear to god I’ll do whatever it takes
If you get me away from this empty space
This empty place without your face
You gave me love and you gave me grace
Taught me to never give up and to not be afraid

And I’m sorry that I got distant
I’m sorry, I should have listened
when mom told me to come visit
I took for granted what I had been given

And now it’s too late,
Your body rests in the grave
And I have to accept that
I can’t change yesterday
But I can change my ways today
I can show my kids that I overcame
The mountains that stood in my way
By giving them love
and doing whatever it takes
So I don’t burden them
with making the same mistakes

You showed up when others gave up
And to me that’s the definition of love
Every time that I fell you would pick me back up
Wipe the tears from my eyes
and remind me that I was tough,
you said some days would be rough
and some days are just filled with bad luck
but keep showing up, keep going forward and don’t stop when you start to feel stuck

Dad, I get my light from you
I shine bright when darkness consumes
I see the world in ways that make others confused
Cause they can’t see the glow that I produce
But really they need it more than I do
I’m sorry to anyone if I ever hurt you
I finally see the path that I was meant to
Everett, Lydia and Rayna I love you

One hundred thirty seven,
that’s how many days it’s been
Since you departed
To your final destination

There’s a black hole swallowing
The last fragments of you here with me
It’s not fair I’m held down by gravity
While you’re spirits out there orbiting
Into the unknown of the cosmos

You are Love
You are who I strive to be
You are Love
Your light illuminates inside me

I find peace with his memories
And all that he did for me

Those Are the Things I’m Reminded of Every time I Think about My Father. It’s what Keeps Me Motivated and what Keeps Me in Check when I’m not Living the way He Had Shown Me. It’s Never Too Late to Change, it’s Never Too Late to Outgrow the People Who don’t Bring the Same Positive Energy in Your Life as You Do and that Includes Family. You Might Be Connected by Blood but there Are People out there Who Are Bonded to You by Real Love, People Who Will Go to War and Fight Your Demons with You. Instead of Using Them to Hurt You. People Who won’t Abandon You when You Feel like Giving Up. People Who Still Continue to Show up even when it’s Inconvenient. People Who don’t want Anything from You but Your Company

## 2021-07-09T02:53:00.000Z -

Eight years ago, back in the Summer of 2013, I found an app called “Day One ” It was and still is labeled as a “Journaling App” but it really is so much more. From time to time I go through these phases of wanting to write my thoughts down, privately just me and my thoughts. What I’m feeling, how I’m feeling, where I’m at in life, who Im with, what I love, what I hate and so on. So I thought I would give this app a shot and write down a few words here and there and I would grow out of it and discard it as time went by. Here’s the thing, I never got tired or bored with it, I actually started using it more and more each year. Looking back now, I have come to understand and realize this isn’t just a journal, this is my journey through life as an adult, more so, every entry is a blueprint from where I was to where Im at now.

So many of the earlier entries are filled with frustration, confusion, sadness, bitterness and negativity. So many entries, that looking back now I realize, just how selfish and naive I was being sometimes. Moments back in time where I swore I was right or that my opinion was the only one that mattered. I am so glad that regardless of how or what I was feeling in those moments, I decided to take the time to write them down, because now I am able to go back and see things from a different perspective and change the things that I was once unwilling to before. The thing about making mistakes is we don’t like to acknowledge them or admit to them, we like to pretend they never happened and bury them deep enough that we forget about them, or we like to put the blame on other people, usually the ones that love us the most. Sometimes it really feels like we would rather put that weight and that blame on other people and know that it will impact them in heavy ways, than to actually admit we are at fault and take responsibility for actions. I understand now just how deep those scars can go and where that road can take you, when you carry the blame and the burden of someone else’s mistakes and when you put that blame and burden onto others as well. I have tried to document any and all of my mistakes and I haven’t deleted a single one, instead I go back and place tags on those entries on whether or not I have taken responsibility for them or whether I have learned from them.

I started with a single Journal and now Im up to 39, as I mentioned earlier, this isn’t just a journal to write what you’re feeling or going through, there are so many things that can be integrated with it as well, using IFTTT, iOS Shortcuts, Facebook, Instagram, it can track your entire location each day and automatically create an entry of where you were and what you were doing, you can upload photos, videos, documents, create voice entries and even send text messages to different journals to create a new entry. Most of my journals are automated by certain criteria.

I have always wanted to do better and be better and I feel like I’m a lot better than I use to be but I know I’m not even close to where I want to be.

It’s never too late to change or to do better.

That is all.

Dear son,

Im sorry that this took so long
Its been really hard to paint a picture of my thoughts

Its not easy to convert
These feelings and these words
Into a simple song

First things first,

When i get nervous, I forget the words
I get embarrassed And that shit hurts

Then i look stupid Like i haven't rehearsed
But i swear to god I rehearsed this verse
So many damn times The pages burnt

And just when i think
That it cant get worse
Anxiety won’t let me
Calm my nerves
I get angry and i curse
At those that don’t deserve
To feel so hurt
Because of my words

Sometimes i feel like i’m not good enough
A feeling that overwhelms my thoughts
Until i feel like i should just give up

My thoughts start
To make me feel insecure

Im at war with my mind
Seems like all the time
Some days i hate my life
Some days i am fine

I only see the rain on my bad days
That's when i know im in a bad place
That's when i know

Press play and listen to me

## 2021-08-21T22:13:53.975Z - LifeTaker

Bitch,
You know you ain’t good at anything but sucking dick
Yea, you fuckin faggot piece of shit
I hate the fucking air that you breathe
And I wish that you were deceased

And I hit back when I come back you know
Everything that I do got that perfect flow
And I’m losing control of all that I know
Every time when I say things
Man you’re not listening
And you stab be in the fucking back and then

I crawl up out my grave and
The sights I’m dialing in, oh no
Keep talking all that shit Bitch
I pull that trigger back
While I’m aiming down the barrel
At your mother fucking face
And its time you get a taste

You piece of shit
Better fucking own your shit
Better get the fuck down on your knees and take a hit, Mother Fucker

End up in the grave
Where you belong I promise one day
Me and you gonna come face to face
And we’ll end this shit the right way
The only way that I can find
Some peace in my mind

Right way.
The right way
Ends with you in the grave
Better live now while you can

Aiming down the barrel at your mother fucking face

It’s been a minute since I crawled out of my grave
It’s been a minute since I’ve had something to say
I thought this part of me had forever away
Turns out it looks like we’re here to stay

I have these visions of
another life
where I’m somebody else

I see a family that’s
always happy
But that’s a fairy tale

My mind is fractured
Broken so much it’s a hazard
A different me every day
gets manufactured

## 2021-08-28T19:28:57.076Z - Gravedigger

They say happiness is the best revenge. I’ll never believe in that garbage. The best revenge is when you show them their biggest mistake was believing you could never do anything to get out from the castle they built on top of you and that they never should have never doubted you and brick by brick you remove as they continue to joke about you. I’ve been patient, Waiting till the time is right when they think you are finally gone and you pull the last brick out and show them they were wrong. Don’t underestimate the person you tried to bury, cause nothing but time exists down in that cemetery. Happiness is revenge and I will be there to tell everyone how it ends. Grave digger, you should have dug that grave a little deeper. Should have finished what you started,

With every passing day the wind blows a little more on this ocean I have made and before long its going to cause a tidal wave and in the middle of that will be your name. So enjoy your happiness today because eventually that happiness will be buried in my old grave

Last year I was such a mess but this year I will get my revenge because there will be no peace between us three until I get back the life you stole from me

Grave Digger, you should have buried me a lot more deeper
Betrayer, its time for you to take my place in that casket you put me in.

## 2021-08-28T21:39:34.693Z - I’m Filled with Hate

Such a bitter rage
I can’t contain
Every time I see your face
I want to put you in the grave
Make no mistake
It will happen one day

I am your karma
I’m what you created

They call me death
When my eyes glow red
Standing at the edge of your bed
Taking your last breath

Hello friend
We meet again
Do you remember who I am
Or did you forget?
I go by Greg
But you always
called me death
And I’m here to protect

They call me death
Or did you forget

I come to life
And take the light
In your mind
Every time
You get lost inside
From all the pain
and the trauma
That you hide

I’m what keeps you alive
When you’re thinking suicide
And you just wanna die
But it’s not your time

## 2021-08-28T21:48:52.819Z -

2 years ago I invited you in my home
Next thing I know, my entire life you stole
You think im really gonna let that go?
Fuck no.
I lost everything I owned
to a bum ass joke

Watched me move out my own house
So you could have what was mine now
Took my crown and turned my life upside down
And you did it with a smile you fucking clown

I know you think you got away with it
No remorse for the crimes you committed
But ive been paitient, I've been waiting for the right time, when you think its all behind
So by the time you see whats coming, therell be no chance of running,
bitch im huntin and im gunnin,
youre in my sights, pull back the trigger, bet you never figured that id be the reaper, guess that's karma mother fucker,
you aint laughing now though,
not with that fucking bullet in your dome, you been convicted and sentenced to death row, case closed.

## 2021-08-28T22:07:27.038Z - Revenger

In the dead of the night
breathe in and out
As I come back to life
With open eyes
I realize
I’m in this casket
Where I died

I see you’re home
I am a ghost
Creepin through your window

Hey mother fucker
Did you think that I’d forget?
Did you really think
You’d get away with it

Well guess what?
You’re fucked
This time
you’re gonna die
By my hand

I got this blade
With your name on it
I’ve got some pain
You’re gonna feel it

Back to hell
Where you belong
Mother Fucker
I promise you
This time it is on

In the dead of night
I come alive
I am the Reaper
You’re gonna die

I’ve got this blade
With your name on it
I’ve got some pain
And you’re gonna feel it

You took your knife
And stabbed me In the back
You took my whats mine,
You took my home
And everything I owned and
You smiled so wide
As you watched me die
But that’s alright
Cause now you’re running out of time

The Hell you put me and my children through
Is now coming back to you
This is vengeance
It’s time we end this

My eyes are glowing red

It’s me the Reap I’m creeping
Through your house
As you’re sleeping

Don’t underestimate the person you tried to bury,
cause nothing but time exists down in that cemetery.
Happiness is revenge
and I will be there to tell everyone how it ends.
Gravedigger, you should have buried me a lot more deeper.
Gravedigger, you should have

I know you’re home
Just want you to know
You ain’t gotta be alone

Dear friends and family
I hope that you can hear me

Number 1 is a bullet in a gun
Pull the trigger and it’s done
Number 2 was all about you
And the hell you put me through

## 2021-08-29T01:48:46.323Z - Please Erase

all the memories I hate
All the ones that have your face
Please stay away
I don’t want to feel this way
So broken every day
I just want to get away
But at this rate
I know nothings gonna change

Every time you call
I’m
Doesn’t matter what you do
I’m always there for you
And you turn your back on me
And leave me there to bleed
Watch me as I sink
While I drown in defeat
Chasing down these drinks
Can’t escape the thoughts I think
Am I always gonna feel empty

## 2021-08-29T01:52:49.574Z - I Finally Got My Mind Right

I finally get to tell my mom
That I don't wanna die
cause now I'm alright

I hope that she can see it in my eyes
when I say I'm really trying

And I hope that you know
that I'm focused on my goals
And the things that matter most
Turning sorrow into gold
Lighting up all the rooms
When I walk in cause I glow

## 2021-08-29T01:54:00.421Z - Midnight the Ball is Dropping

Brought New Years in with Tawnie
Finally found somebody who gets me
Unaware she’s been there since beginning

A promise to my son, both my daughters
and everybody that I love
that I was done with all the bullshit I was on and I will rebuild from the bottom up

## 2021-08-29T01:54:23.510Z - Oh This January Weather Got Me Feeling so Frozen

Got my heart turning cold like it’s 40 below and nobody knows cause I don’t let it show no I don’t

You woke me from a dead sleep
You always find a way to haunt me in my dreams you always find a way to suffocate me till I can’t breathe, till I’m just a dead man walking

I’ll never forget that night
you looked me in the eyes
and said I love you
as you stabbed me in the chest
I stood in shock as I bled
And with my one last breath
I saw you smile as I was met by death

Now I’m just a ghost
Watch me as I float
through the airwaves unknown
It’s dark and I’m all alone

A broken record composed
by the one who hurt me the most

stuck in a loop of memories
and I hope you think of me
when you come into that frequency,
every time you hear that familiar sound
of me hurting so achingly,

I hope you remember
that you were the one who killed me
and there’s no going back,
you can’t bring the dead back from that,
I’m trapped in the past and I can’t come back
And that’s a fact cause You made sure of that

## 2021-08-29T01:54:56.522Z - I’m Filled with Hate

Cause you were never my friend
Just a snake who’s a fake
Some day you will be replaced
Guess that’s fate
don’t care about what you say
It never mattered anyways
Instead I’ll take all the blame
I don’t play the games you play

Another day can’t wash away
All the pain and all the hate

Hell is where you can stay
Fuck you for everything

## 2021-08-29T01:56:36.815Z - I Hope This Finds You well

I hope that you’re ok
I hope you smile more
With each and every day

And I hope
that you know
That There’s no lengths I won’t go
To pull you from the undertow
As it grabs a hold
no I won’t let you go
I promise to keep you afloat
As your anxiety overflows

I’ll be your boat I’ll guide you home
Shelter the rain warmth through the snow
Care for your heart watch as it grows
Stand by your side when you’re feelin low
Cry on my shoulder laugh at my jokes
Get rid of the pain replace it with hope
Get rid of the chains get rid of the the rope
Give you more air to breathe through the smoke

I’ll be the light into the unknown
I’ll be the fight that keeps you from ghosts
I’ll be the time you pause and rewind
I’ll be the fire you set to aspire

You are not alone to me you are my home

## 2021-08-29T01:57:15.162Z - Midnight Thoughts

There was a time not too long ago, that I had lost all hope, all ambition and all of myself. I was a victim to my own self defeat and in that I grew comfortable. I was ok with my life going nowhere for a long time. My views on myself and the world around me grew so dark, so negative that I dimmed all the light that was actually surrounding me. Some people stay in that place their whole lives but one day I started trying again, trying to live, trying to find a job I would actually like working at and through that little bit of effort at the beginning, I found myself with a surprising amount of opportunities. There were no hand outs, I made no excuses for myself, I just wanted more from my life than I had settled for, I wanted the things I felt deeply that I truly deserved.

## 2021-08-29T01:59:16.425Z -

Oh look who I found
I got you now
You fuckin clown

Light a match and watch you burn
You know this Is exactly what you deserve
Tell me how’s it feel to hurt the way I hurt
I Hope that it was worth it when your ass is in the dirt

You can scream for help
But
this ain’t home its hell
Bruh
This is my revenge on
All the shit you did
Yuh
This my show and tell
Bitch

Ain’t no way
That I’m a change
My minds been made

You die today
You can’t escape
This is your fate

You’re all alone

That’s how it goes
Its what you chose
you turned me cold
And I won’t ever let this go

Told you we’d meet again
And I’d get you in the end

So scream all you want

Nobody gonna find your body
When there’s no body left
Yuh

I’ve been waiting for this day
Since I crawled out of the grave
I remembered it was your face
That put me in this place

The one you put me in
I remember like it was yesterday
I Think your skins began to melt
Right off your face
Yuh
All you want to
Down here in hell
Nobody hears you

Dad I miss you and I hate that you’re gone
I hope you know I loved you so much
You were the best part of growing up
Together you and me had so much fun

you don’t need a cape to be great

It was just me and mom till I was five
That’s when you came into my life
You took me in

Lately I’m wondering if you’ve been staring down at me from heaven

My father told me do everything with love
To show up every day, give it my best
and to never give up

Dad you made me proud
I sing it loud
that I’m so damn proud
I wonder if you can
hear me now
Up past the clouds
Through the airwaves
Into the heavens now

If you can hear me
I hope you know
Your love was gold
I love the way you shined
With a heart that always glowed

But now I’m...
heartbroken
This sucks and
I miss you
So much and
I know that
you’re never coming
Home again
No, no

Tell me all about your life and what it’s like to be a man
I just think about how you saved my life
when you wore that cape and you wore that smile
And I miss you, I fucking miss you, oh no

It’s not the same without you
I hope you can hear me
I hope you know that
I loved you so deeply

My father told me do everything with love
To show up every day, give it my best
and to never give up

He said “Son, just do your best”

Dad I miss you and I hate that you’re gone
I hope you know I loved you so much
you were the best part of growing up
together you and me had so much fun

I know that you’re in a better place

## 2021-08-29T06:18:57.521Z - Let Me Down (Revised)

Yea every word is truth
Bout everything that I been going through
Every moment feeling blue
My thoughts have me consumed
Fantasize hanging by a fucking noose
My heart can't take anymore abuse
So sick of feeling used by you

Let me down
Lock the door on your way out
Don't come back need solid ground
I need peace need to heal right now
Let me down
Lock the door on your way out
Don't come back need solid ground
I need peace need to heal right now

You think I'm sad and pathetic
I think that I need a medic
For the sickness you inflicted
In my mind I can't forget it
You an addict
For being dramatic
This time ive had it
Turned my back and you stabbed it
Cause you savage causing havoc
In everything you do
Every word you fucking say
All the hell you put me through

Let me down
Lock the door on your way out
Don't come back need solid ground
I need peace need to heal right now
Let me down
Lock the door on your way out
Don't come back need solid ground
I need peace need to heal right now

## 2021-08-29T06:56:59.367Z - Medicate Me

my thoughts have got me fucked up,
can't get my mind to shut off
Dr please just give me some drugs
Medicate me til I go numb
Hard to accept what we've become
Maybe I'll sleep and won't wake up

I don't know how
to let you go
For so long you've
been all I know
You and I were
supposed to grow old
If you're not mine
I'd rather die alone

Please don't wake me up
I don't ever want to wake up
To know that I'm stuck
here all alone and
you out there somewhere
Don't even know where

I know I can't go on like this

All I do is fucking miss that life
Miss your face and how you smiled so wide
Miss all those nights that I held you tight
You're still all I see when I close my eyes

Late nights find me

My mind just replays all of my mistakes
And I feel like I can't change, that I'll always be this wa

I come alive
I am the Reaper
You’re gonna die
Hey mother fucker
Did you think that I’d forget?
Did you really think
You’d get away with it?
Well guess what?
You’re fucked
This time
You’re gonna die
By my hand
I got this blade
With your name on it
I’ve got some pain
You’re gonna feel it
Back to hell
Where you belong
So you can pay for
What you’ve done

## 2021-08-31T03:53:01.024Z - I Have This Recurring Dream Every Night

That I'm in another life and you're at my bedside
I hear our kids calling out for mom and dad
As they rush in our rooms and nobody is sad

I feel loved, I feel enough, I feel like I hit a gold Rush
Life isn't rough, I feel your touch there's no better outcome

I'm back at my old job perfect attendance and all
Got my own office with our family picture on the wall
And my mom called just to say she was proud of me
And that I was so blessed to have such a loving family

This is it, I finally made it, I achieved everything I've been chasin
I've never been so high, I feel so alive coming home to those I love every night

And just as I get in the drive way I hear the radio turn to static
And I when I look up I see our house has turned into nothing but ashes
And there's a siren going off as if to warn me to find somewhere safe
And as I start to run the ground begins to fold by an earthquake
And by then it's too late cause im falling down to what must be my fate
And just before death takes me, I see my wife tell me it's time for me to awake

I open my eyes and there's no one at my bedside
And now I really wish that dream was real and I had just died
Nobody knows me better than my own mind, so why does it want me to hate my life

Just let me sleep, let me be happy in that dream for eternity.

## 2021-08-31T03:53:49.756Z - I've Lost so Many Nights of Sleep

Due to my depression and anxiety
My own mind playing tricks on me
I can't tell if I'm awake or it's a dream

I'm haunted by my past mistakes
A constant movie that's stuck on replay
And all I want is to get away
But I feel stuck in a rut I can't escape

I write about my life and about what's wrong and right
About the times my heart was broke and I was dead inside
People started to relate and look to me for guidance
I don't have all the answers but I'm someone you can confide in
All I can say is you gotta push through the pain
Wake up every day and paint a smile on your face
Even when you're not ok even when the color turns to gray cause eventually those clouds wil

## 2021-08-31T03:55:21.966Z - Endings Are Hard, Life Changing, Sometimes Life Ending, I Think It's Safe to Say I'll Never Be the Same Person I Was before 2017. Dreams Were Shattered, Love Was Broken, Hope Was Lost. That Fear of Monsters Being Real as a Child Came to Life only Those Monsters Never Came from under the Bed or out of the Closet, They Disguised Themselves in Human Form. They Became the Reason I Never Slept, They Got in My Head and Made Me Question My Self Worth, They Made Me Believe I Would Never Be Anything and I'd Never Be Happy Again. They Made Me Question My Own Life Every Day until I Started Becoming One of Them Myself. My Whole Life I Lived by a Set of Standards and Morals so that I Would Never Cross over to the Dark Side. I Had Boundaries, Lines that I Would Never Cross to Keep Me Safe from Being the next Anakin Skywalker and now I Understand Exactly why He Became Darth Vader because when People You Love Fuck You up and Show You a Side of Themselves and Life that You Never Thought Were Real, it Creates a Catastrophic Chain of Events inside Your Belief System and in the Foundation You've Built Your Life Upon. Love Turned into Pain, Pain Turned into Hate and Hate Turned into Feeling Nothing. What I've Learned is that Hate is not the Greatest Negative Emotion, Feeling Nothing Is, because if You Hate Something It's for a Reason, a Purpose, but to Feel Nothing and Do Things that Hurt People for no Reason, for no Purpose, You Can Really Fuck the World up and far Too Many of Us Feel Nothing Anymore. For a long time I Balanced Myself on All the Lines that I Swore I Would Never Cross and than One by One I Didn't Care Anymore and after Every line I Crossed that Structure and Foundation of Who I once Was Started Caving In. Wall after Wall, Floor after Floor until it Buried Me underneath it and it Wasn't until the Basement Collapsed that I Realized there is no Rock Bottom, There's no Bottom at All to the Holes We Dig for Ourselves, It's Never Ending and You Can just Keep Going until the Consequences of Your Actions and Choices Catch up to You and either Kill You or Mentally Impair You

## 2021-08-31T03:55:44.987Z - If You Were to Write Your Life Story, how Many of You Could Say that You Didn't Have a Single Villain or Negative Person in It?

Most of us have at least one person who damaged or broke us in some way that we were never the same afterwards.

Those people were the turning point in whether we chose to hurt others as they did to us

or if we realized
we would never want the people we love to feel the way
all the people that fucked us up did

By the time my story is finished, I won't have a single villain in it because the world has enough shitty people and every person that has ever hurt me, defined me and made me into a better person each time.

So they are not villians, they are just supporting actors and actresses who helped me see a better world and live without negativity.

The best way to take away a villains superpower, is to erase their existence and turn them into something that made you a better person

## 2021-08-31T03:56:34.980Z - One Thing I've come to Realize the Most is that Our Inner Demons Aren't there to Hurt Us, They're there to Hurt All the People that Love Us, They Take Them out One by One until It's just You and Them and then They Become You. I See it All around Me, even in Myself. So much Darkness, so much Anger, so much Misunderstanding and All that Does is Bring Those Demons to Life. They Are Awaken from Hibernation by Your Surroundings, by the Trauma, the Environment, Anxiety, Bad Relationships, Anything that is Negative. You Don't Have to come from a Broken Home, You Don't Have to Be Abused as a Child, They Don't just come out because of Your Childhood, I Think that a Lot of Them Probably Stem from Your Childhood but They Thrive More in Your Adulthood because You no Longer Have that Innocence You Had as a Child to Protect You. We Are All Born with the Sense of Wrong and Right and the Ability to Be Good or Bad. It All Comes down to a Choice, a line Drawn between the light and the Darkness and once You Cross that line You Better Distance Your Self from Everyone Who Cares about You because You've just Become a Ticking time Bomb to All of Them, but of Course It's Too Late for that Cause that Good part of You is now Permanently in the Passenger Seat while Your Demons come to Life

## 2021-08-31T03:56:50.205Z - I Started to Write You a Book but I Don't Need to Anymore for the First time in Eight Years You and I Are on the Same Exact Page and I Couldn't Be Any More Fucking Proud of You for Finally Coming forward and Telling Me the Truth so that I Could Be Free of This Hell We Have Been In. I Never Would Have Chased You Had I Known You Truly Didn't want Me but We Are Good. As for Tyler I Don't Ever Have to Forgive Him and He Will Always Be Something that I Will not Say in This Message because I Know It's Disrespectful towards You but I Am Never Going to Cause Drama between You Two I Will Let You to Be as Happy or as Miserable as You Guys want to Be and by the End of This Weekend I Am Cutting Ties with All of Your Family and not like on a Some Fuck Shit but to Remind Them that You Are Their Family and Their Sister it Doesn't Matter what You Choose or Who You Choose to Be with They Need to Support You and only You and that There's no Hard Feelings on Anybody's Side. I'm not Going to Give You a Single Reason to Ever come at Me as a Reason why Shit Didn't Work out This time Around. I Got Nothing but Love for Your Family. And Nothing but respect for You Finally Owning Your Shit. I Have no Regrets Stevie, I Made Mistakes, and I Became a Better Person but the Fact that You Didn't want Me and Pretended that Was Brought the Worst out of Me. I Hope You Never Ever Put Anybody through that Ever Again because Had This Gone Any Further in a Negative Direction I Have no Doubt in My Mind I Would Have Killed All of Us just to Be Free of This Curse. Thank You for Setting Me Free I Mean that Shit You Will not Hear from Me Again

You're going to get hurt many times throughout your life, sometimes for unexplained reasons, sometimes because certain people enjoy seeing you hurt, but whatever the reason is or may be, we all do the same thing from a very young age. We build a defense system and put up walls to prevent others from hurting us anymore than we've already been hurt. (Is everyone still following and on the same page with me here?) Now this is where most of us fuck up, not because we put up giant walls and keep upgrading the security system. (I agree that to an extent we all need this system in place to protect us.) Here's the issue, how many people out there know what a firewall is and how to actually use it? A firewall is exactly the type of defense system we install in ourselves, it's there to protect us from incoming threats and to regulate us from sending too much of ourselves to the wrong people. I have found that the majority of us tend to stick to the default setting though and all of you default settings peeps out there is what's fucking everyone's love life up

## 2021-08-31T03:58:00.533Z - At This point in Life I'm a 35 Year Old Single Father of 3 Beautiful Children. Currently Trying to Rebuild My Life after a Heartbreaking Divorce and a Meth Addiction. There Are so Many Reasons why I Am where I Am, Some Are Simply because of Misfortune and Things out of My Control but Most Were Honestly My Fault

At a young age we develop certain senses of wrong and right, good and bad and so on. My life has always been run by emotions, my moods and my choices always stem from whatever emotion I am feeling at those times.

In 2008 I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on Adderall by 2012 I was on the maximum dosage of 60 mg a day. That drug was my lifeline, it made me into a completely different person, it made me dive head first into my passion of creating music and thrive in every work environment I was in. It got me promoted to jobs I never would have been interested in before, I was making money I had never been able to make previously, but it came with a price. The biggest price of them all. It cost me my wife, my children and my friend's. I put all my time and effort into things that really didn't matter at the end of the day, all my attention went to myself and how long can you neglect the people that love and care about you before they give up on you? 6 years was my answer to that. 6 years of neglect to my then wife and to my son and my daughter's, to my friends and family members. I was a recluse. A machine, a robot working only for myself and when everything finally came crashing down, the last person I wnted to blame was myself. I wanted to be angry at everyone else but myself, I wanted crucify those closest, mostly my ex wife. I know she tried to get me to see where I was going wrong and what I was doing wrong. How I was lacking in being a boyfriend, than in being a husband and finally in being a father.

I care so deeply about people yet I lack so much in showing it.

## 2021-08-31T03:58:41.515Z - You’re The Best

It's been 2 years now that I'm still at my mom's
I hope she's knows I'm so thankful for all that she's done
Not just for me but for my children too
Cause we all been through the ringer, including you (and you have too)

I know I've been a wreck,
I been a mess
and that I cannot handle my stress
but I Promise I am tryin my best
to start being myself again

But I'm not sure who the hell I am
I gave everything to those who don't give a damn
I don't need a hand, I need a plan
I need you to understand
Right now I am a broken man
I'm doing all that I can
To put this into action
With a lighter and a gas can
I'll light
While I hit the gas and
And get some cash for
The bitch who is too bad

The day after Green.
I spent these last 6 months locked inside my room, taking pills to kill all the thoughts of me and you. I was just wasting my life, got pretty good at almost dying.
Left a note for friends and family that read "I'm sorry please forgive me, it was an accident"
but that was an excuse to not make me feel like such a coward, cause every time I took those pills I thought of you, I hoped and prayed they would take me back in time, so I could show you that you meant everything.
But the sun would always rise and I'd wake up in a bed full of sweat, cold and alone.
On repeat day after day until st patties when I chased the white down with the blue, and tried to drink enough to forget you....and it all went black and I realized where I was at.
I saw my friends all in front of me and a son with out his daddy, saw my mom all alone crying as they buried me. I smelled the perfume of a girl that I once knew, remembered how much she loved me. There were flowers on my grave and I heard my father say "why did you leave us this way" I tried to tell him I was sorry but the words just came out blurry
and all the sudden I wake up and it's 730 Friday morning, I peeled my face off the kitchen floor, tried to figure out if I was dead or dreaming and then it hit me that I was alive and this might be the only chance I get to set things right.

My head was a mess back then, I couldn't see the truth, that you were always there for me whenever I needed you. I can't explain what happened, I'm still learning to be human, I'm still trying to say I'm sorry for the nights you stayed up crying. If I could change one thing, itd be my 24th bday, when you gave me that picture frame and I pretended it meant nothing. I detached myself from you, said it was for the best cause I met someone new and I threw away our lives for someone I barely knew and I've spent these last few years questioning the truth. The truth is sometimes painful and we have both felt that role, of caring for someone who thought it was better to let them go. Now I realize you were that one piece I couldn't make fit cause I never took the time to open my eyes and see the bigger picture, that life is a puzzle we put together and it's canvas is sometimes dark and the scene can paint nightmares of your world being torn apart. You are the glue that held me together

They say happiness is the best revenge.
I’ll never believe in that garbage.
The best revenge is when you show them their biggest mistake was believing you could never do anything to get out from the castle they built on top of you
and that they should have never doubted you and brick by brick you remove from the rubble they left you in as they continue to joke about you.
I’ve been patient, Waiting till the time is right when they think I’m finally gone and I pull the last brick out and show them they were wrong.
Don’t underestimate the person you tried to bury,
cause nothing but time exists down in that cemetery.
Happiness is revenge and I will be there to tell everyone how it ends.
Grave digger, you should have dug that grave a little deeper.
Should have finished what you started

I still go back to that day
Back to that night
When you took everything
My whole life, mother fucker

You're lucky I didn't blast
your fucking ass right there
As you watched me move out of my house
You sat your ass in my chair

On the porch
As me and Travis loaded up his car
I never knew this could be so hard
Having your heart torn apart

By another man
walking up into your home
Acting like he owns that shit
before you even go
And the next thing that you know
You ain't got a place to fuckin go
Cause that home ain't you home!

You've been thrown out in the cold
That person you loved is no longer yours to hold
And never in your life have you ever felt so alone
And on your own
As you struggle to survive
when all you really want is just to really fucking die
Cause now the only thing you have
is all this fuckin time
and all you ever do is keep
tryin to talk to god to ask him why?

Taken my wife
And everything that was mine

Stabbed me in the back
With my own knife
Dug me a grave
Left me buried inside

The best revenge is when you show them their biggest mistake was believing you could never do anything to get out from the castle they built on top of you, that they should have never doubted you.

You have to dig yourself out from the grave they left you in.

Should have finished what you started

I know you think you got away with it
No remorse for the crimes you committed
But ive been paitient, I've been waiting for the right time, when you think its all behind
So by the time you see whats coming, therell be no chance of running,
bitch im huntin and im gunnin,
youre in my sights, pull back the trigger, bet you never figured that id be the reaper, guess that's karma mother fucker,
you aint laughing now though,
not with that fucking bullet in your dome, you been convicted and sentenced to death row, case closed.

Climb Out From Your Cemetery

You Should Make Sure The Dead Stay Buried

These days are all the same
I wish that I could really change
But everything in me
just wants to get away
And I don’t know
what to do anymore
I see the light ahead
But I’m not going for it
Now I guess that
I’m drowning in my misery
Cause I know
That I’m alone
In my mind
It’s all I’ve ever known

I see a tree ahead
And maybe I should swerve for it
Cause all I know right now
Is that I’m too fucking depressed
To get on with my life
I wish that I could ask for help
But I don’t need your help
No more
This time I think
I’m better dead
On the floor

With my own knife
Dug me a grave
Left me buried inside

I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and look where I am at
Oh the Reaper is coming for you
Don’t you know

End up in the grave
Where you belong I promise one day
Me and you gonna come face to face
And we’ll end this shit the right way
The only way that I can find
Some peace in my mind

I’ll end this shit
The right way
The only way that I can find
Some peace in my mind
Right way
Yea the, the right way
Ends with you in the grave
Better live now while you can

I told you when you closed that casket
That I would be back and
now look where I am at and
I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at and
Oh no aiming down the barrel at your mother fucking face I know

I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at and
I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at

## 2021-09-06T00:57:01.905Z - SEVEN

It's been 7 years to the day
When your mom she called me
To tell me your heart stopped beating
I felt my chest sink to my gut
And in that moment the whole world stopped
And I ran out the door before that phone could hit the floor,

I thought if I kept running, running, running
I could build enough momentum,
to travel back in time and rewrite your life
just like the flash and I will bring you back
and when I arrived I saw your mother's eyes and I knew that it was too late

And that I failed you I'm sorry
Told your mom not to worry
That he would be alright
And everything will turn out fine
I guess I'm a liar now
As we buried you in the ground
In that tiny little casket
Where the fucks our God now

I thought that after you were gone,
Me and your mom we'd hold on
and stay strong
you were are closest bond
but I was wrong cause see your mom
she blamed me for so long
Said it was all my fault, all my fault
And she would never let it go
Oh Im sorry Stevie
But I can't carry that weight any longer
Any longer
Im sorry I let you down
Sorry that I made you drown
That was never my intention
Im not perfect, no Im not perfect
But I never meant to take
Our first born son away
Never meant to make you feel this way
Never meant to make you feel so much pain
Oh God its been so hard,
living without you here
Seems like its an eternity
But its been Seven years
Since we buried you

## 2021-09-06T04:52:03.363Z - Maybe This Time It’s Forever

Lately I been going crazy,
hoping maybe somebody
will come and save me
I know it's wishful thinking

I been stuck inside
this mind of mine
For quite some time
Hoping that I will make it out alive

And where were you
all those fucking times when I needed you?
And where were you
when I was down and out
you were nowhere to be found?

Find me half dead, laying in the gutter
Nothing left, I'm homeless in November
If I meant something, I guess I don't remember
I'm all alone out here while you found another
Find me half, dead laying in the gutter
Nothing left, I'm homeless in November
If I meant something, I guess I don't remember
I'm all alone out here while you found another

Than it's right back
To the things that
Make me feel trapped
And I hate that

Mother fucker better know that
Just a door mat
Where your homes at

Got all of dis Shit that I can not get passed
(Yeah)
I know now that Good things never last
(No)
Why's it gotta be like that
(No)
It Ain't gotta be like that
(No)

I'm all alone and on my own I guess forever

Losing hope
Let me go
Lost my home
I'm letting go

I'm down and out
Been So lost now
I feel so empty
Gave so much of me
Till Nothing left of me

Hard to believe
I'm worth anything
When the people I love
always up and leave

It's hard to see
Where I want to be
When everything
Feels out of reach

Hard to breathe
With this anxiety
Inside of me
It's unsettling

Find me half dead, laying in the gutter
Nothing left, I'm homeless in November
Am I really someone who won't be remembered?
As I fall asleep maybe this time it's forever

Than it's right back
To the things that
Make me feel trapped

I got love
but I ain’t got no love for myself
I got hate
cause I see it everyday
When I catch the reflection of my face
Fucking Staring back at me

I got some demons
that want released and
With good reason
They will reap
like it’s open season
While I get crucified
As if I committed treason

## 2021-10-06T03:20:24.757Z - Jax Dialogue

It's hard not to hate. People, things, institutions, when they break your spirit and take pleasure in watching you bleed, hate is the only feeling that makes sense.

But I know what hate does to a man, tears him apart, turns him into something he's not, something he promised himself he'd never become.

That's what I need to tell you, to let you know how hard I’m trying not to cave under the weight of all the awful things I feel in my heart

Sometimes my life feels like a deadly balancing act, what I feel slamming up against what I should do, impulsive reactions racing to solutions miles ahead of my brain.

When I look at my day, I realize that most of it was spent cleaning up the damage of the day before. In that life I have no future, all I have is distraction and remorse.

Everyday is a new box, you open it and take a look at what's inside. You're the one who determines if it's a gift or a coffin.

Maybe that’s the lesson for me today, to hold onto these simple moments, appreciate them a little more. There’s not many of them left.

I don’t ever want that for you. Finding things that make you happy shouldn’t be so hard. I know you’ll face pain, suffering, hard choices but you can’t let the weight of it choke the joy out of your life.

No matter what, you have to find the things that love you and run to them.

There’s an old saying “that which doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” I don’t believe that, I think the things that try to kill you, make you angry and sad.

Strength comes from the good things, your family, your friends, the satisfaction of hard work. Those are the things that will keep you whole. Those are the things to hold onto when you’re broken.

There will be days when you’re forced to make decisions that affect the lives of everyone you love. Choices that will change you forever.

You reach an age where you realize that being a man isn’t about respect or strength, it’s about being aware of all the things you touch.

Children face inward, wallow in their own selfish needs.

Men face out, take action on the needs of others.

## 2021-10-08T20:07:40.965Z -

There are lessons to be found here,
but mostly, I do this so you can know me.
Lately, as I write these, I realize they are as much for me
as they are for you.
This is the one place I can be completely open.
The pen and paper has no judgment.

It simply receives my truth
and allows me to turn the page.
And today… this is my truth.

I am terrified a great deal of the time.
Afraid of what I’ve done,
of what I’m doing, and of what I might have to do.
It’s not a crippling fear.
In fact, it’s just the opposite.
I thrive on it.
I crave it.
I need that rush of terror to get me out of bed in the morning.
It’s in my DNA.

I always find a reason, a cause,
a need that allows me the karmic lubrication
to stuff my guilt into its savage compartment.

I’ve become the thing…
the one I hated.

And with that awareness comes periods of days,
sometimes weeks, when I have to avoid looking into a mirror.
My self-hate is so deep, so palpable,
I fear I’ll lunge at my own image,
shatter the glass and cut myself with shards of broken reflection.

Forgive my indulgence
But today may be a day we both remember.
A defining day.
And I want you to look back at this entry and know that
at the very least your father was completely honest.

So you know I speak the truth
when I tell you that you are the most important thing to me.
I will never hurt you.
Never abandon you.

I love you,
More than anything or anyone.
I always will.

## 2021-10-08T20:13:43.233Z -

By the time you’re old enough to make sense of this life,
you’ll know everything about me,
the things I’m proud of and the things I regret,
and then you’ll be faced with your own decisions.
And as much as I want to help you, tell you what to do,
those choices will be yours alone.

The only advice I can give you, sons,
is to examine who you are as men.
Figure out what’s important to you.

Know yourselves.
Know what’s in your heart.
Don’t be swayed by fear or history or the opinions of outsiders.
Find your own truth.
It will lead you to the things you love.

## 2021-10-16T03:20:00.000Z - Entry I

It's hard not to hate. People, things, institutions, when they break your spirit and take pleasure in watching you bleed, hate is the only feeling that makes sense.

But I know what hate does to a man, tears him apart, turns him into something he's not, something he promised himself he'd never become.

That's what I need to tell you, to let you know how hard I’m trying not to cave under the weight of all the awful things I feel in my heart

Sometimes my life feels like a deadly balancing act, what I feel slamming up against what I should do, impulsive reactions racing to solutions miles ahead of my brain.

When I look at my day, I realize that most of it was spent cleaning up the damage of the day before. In that life I have no future, all I have is distraction and remorse.

## 2021-10-16T14:23:32.949Z - I’m Sure Most of You Are Unaware that Our Brains Are Actually Made to Work from the Source Code of the Universe, but there’s a Few of Us out there Who Have Learned how to Decode it and Rewrite It. Reading through My Own I Noticed the First Lines of Code Were Very Disappointing

#info <Smith.D>

int begin
{
cout << "Destined To Fail" << endl;
return 0;
}

So I changed it to

#info <Smith.D>

int begin
{
cout << "Has Administrator Privilege To All Internal Coding" << endl;
return 0;
}

And once I gained full access to all of my default settings, I started changing them one by one, line after line until I got to the final output:

#info <Smith.D>

int end
{
cout << "Simulation Is A Success" << endl;
return 0;
}

Once I hit that Enter key, I woke up with the ability to choose more than just the default outcome, I still make mistakes and I still make the wrong choices but instead of repeating them over and over the way I was programmed to, I continuously update those lines of code to have greater odds at making better decisions and with better decisions come a better ending.

## 2021-10-16T15:29:40.457Z - Entry IV

When we take action to avenge the ones we love,
personal justice collides with social and divine justice.
We become judge, jury and god.
With that choice comes daunting responsibility.
Some men cave under that weight, others abuse the momentum.
The true outlaw finds the balance between the passion in his heart and the reason in his mind.

## 2021-10-18T16:13:08.797Z - Desolater

Dear Son, the time has come
to see me for who and what I am
A father turned to monster
Who became obsessed with revenge

That light in me was ripped out
The day that mother fucker
Stepped in my house

He put that knife into my back
Until all I could see was black
I felt so angry and sad
During those last few breaths

Than I felt nothing
Just cold and empty
In an unknown cemetery
Where no one would find me

That’s the day your father died
I’m sorry for the no goodbye
I’m sorry I was a coward that didn’t fight
I never saw it coming till it was already behind

I was buried in a grave of lies
Those lies burned such hate inside
As I got to the gates of the after life
Before The Devil and God I chose a side
I traded my soul for the devils time
A fire so hot it brought me back
But somehow that fire in me came back alive
And I used that same fire to burn out his eyes

## 2021-10-19T14:27:22.782Z - Entry VIIII

I believe in being a good person, doing what’s right for myself and for others.

Caring deeply and treating people with respect. Forgiveness and moving forward.

Choosing love over hate, choosing to walk away instead of fighting.

These are the principles for which I built my entire life upon.

I always believed that no matter what someone has done to you, time will heal you and give you acceptance

But Sometimes something so awful happens to you that you can’t even process or make sense of it.

Sometimes lines get crossed that you never even knew were there.

I still believe in doing the right thing but now realize that there are rare exceptions in which you cannot forgive someone. You can not just turn your back and continue forward, without looking weak, without giving off the impression that what they did to you was ok.

Somethings are not ok and I see now that some people think they can do and take what they want without any consequence or remorse.

Sometimes people cut you so deep that you never stop bleeding

Some people feed off the joy of hurting people

These people become unstoppable, almost invincible as if nothing bad happens to them because they are the bad things to everyone else

I have this inner light that can illuminate the the world around me, and around those near me. who I’ve always chosen corrective action over conflict but this time I could not see a path lit in front of me by the light

As much as that light in me is good I carry that same amount of fire in me that is darkness

I am heaven and I am hell, both trapped in the same vessel

We live a life until that life is done with us and than we live inside the memories of others. Sometimes we are lucky enough to have those we’ve lost live inside the photos and videos, the articles and the digital footprints they left behind but sometimes the people we love the most end up leaving only the memories we have of them.

I’ve been working on a project the last few months that will make sure memories aren’t the only thing I leave behind. It started out as a personal project after my dad died and how non existent his digital foot print in life was. I’ve always had this weird obsession with data, personal data to be more specific. I’ve kept backups of every pc, Mac, iPhone, android, cloud and email accounts for 20 years, unfortunately 99% of my data from 1997-2011 was destroyed because I was ignorant in not believing in multiple backups at the time. Technology and lots of research and trips down the rabbits hole has granted me new knowledge on how to find certain events in my past and collect the data from that era.

I have been building a central repository of all the information I’ve collected on myself and those that are important in my life. My vision is to build a system where I can pull events from any day, week, month or year of my life or my family’s or children’s and see a visual of everything that happened, whether it be a photo, video, text message, voicemail, your exact location and so on. Think of facebooks “on this day” but a summary of every event that day.

## 2021-11-16T20:08:16.295Z - This Entry is Addressed to All Three of My Children

Since my Dad (Your Grandpa Johnnie) died back in February of this year, I’ve been trying to get my life in order so that if anything happens to me, you all will have access to everything that was my life.

I really haven’t had my shit together since me and Stevie got Divorced. I fell apart for 3 straight years and in those 3 years I made a lot of bad decisions, I took that heartbreak out on temporary solutions and sometimes or maybe a lot of times, neglected giving all 3 of you the love and attention you deserve. Just know that is all on me and I take full accountability for it. So please do not grow up believing and thinking that you did anything wrong or that I didn’t care or love you. You 3 are my whole heart and the center of which the world to me pivots on.

In life we make mistakes, we fuck up and than we fuck up some more. What’s important is that we learn from those mistakes and correct our actions and behavior because of those mistakes.

You’re going to have good days and you’re going to have bad days, really bad days and “it’s the end of the fucking world” bad days. The good news is, those days don’t last long and they don’t come around often or at least they shouldn’t.

Life is about living and dreaming and finding out who you are. Do your best to be open minded and kind and caring. Things are going to happen to you that will not be your fault, things that will be out of your control and things that will make you feel shit you never knew existed. Don’t let those things or those people turn your hearts of Gold into Stone. Don’t become the things that hurt you.

## 2021-12-19T20:36:06.647Z - [Tutorial] Executing Terminal Commands, with Filza and without a Mobile Terminal

Not exactly a Tutorial, but a "Tip".I have read a few times, posts of users who when they had to execute commands from the terminal, they replied: "I only have Filza in my device, and Cydia / Zebra does not let me install anything, it gives me errors and I don't have a Mobile Terminal, please help!"So I decided to write these few lines to help some users, remembering that Filza has a built-in terminal, and you can use it.A simple example of a situation I happened to read: Cydia blocked and unable to perform a "user space reboot", no Terminal installed, well then:Open FilzaEnter in "/var/mobile/Documents/"Press "Edit", then ⍐ at the bottom right.Create a new file and name it "soft-reboot.sh"Press "Edit" again, then ⍐ at the bottom right.This time, select "Open With", then "Text Editor"As soon as you open your file, type "launchctl reboot userspace" (make sure it's all lowercase)Press "Save" then "End"You have just created your command to reboot the user space, the "soft reboot", without a Terminal App installed, when you click on your file, before being executed, a confirmation Alert will appear. Filza is magical, it work also in "Safe Mode" and without tweaks or memory consumption.This is just a simple example, commands can be more than one, so you can also run scripts to fix errors or make changes. This is all, simple. I hope this can help someone in the future.Note: please don't write commands you don't know, ask always a more experienced user if you don't know what to do.**

## 2021-12-19T22:04:46.372Z - [Tutorial] Apt-get & Aptitude & Dpkg

Yea, another tutorial /r/jailbreak...Today I want to talk about about Cydia & apt-get & dpkg & aptitude. This tools: apt-get & dpkg & aptitude are unix tools. You can find them pretty much in every Linux.And Cydia is an graphic GUI for apt-get & aptitude.What you need: ssh / terminal access.Apt-get & Aptitude are like Cydia but in text mode. Apt-get is installed by default. Aptitude is "better" version of apt-get - is much more safe and has text GUI. But for now aptitude is broken and we have to wait for fix/update.What the heck I can do with apt-get?Well you can basically do same things which you are doing in Cydia.1. Refresh Repo's2. Install tweaks3. Uninstall tweaks4. Upgrade tweaksSo lets go:To refresh you have to use this command:apt-get updateYou will get a lot of text which is indication that you are downloading release / cache / other packages from repo's.This is basically like hitting "refresh" button in Cydia.This is a tricky one but I will try to explain it briefly. For this purpose we will try to install DockShift from BigBoss (you can check other tweak). To install DockShift we need it identificator which can be found under Details of Package (you need to scroll down to same botton) and its:"de.ng.dockshift"To install this tweak we need to use this command:apt-get install de.ng.dockshift You will be asked if you want to procced so you have to type y for yes or n for no.Last one more thing. To download only *.deb use this:apt-get -d install de.ng.dockshift To claim this *.deb file you have to go to:"/var/cache/apt/archives"There are 2 parameters which do same work but one is only deleting tweak and second one is deleting tweak and its config files.apt-get purge de.ng.dockshiftapt-get remove de.ng.dockshiftI am pretty sure that you will be asked about procceding.From time to time an developer is releasing an update to tweaks and in Cydia you are displayed updates in Changes tab.In text mode after using "apt-get update" you can get info about there is an update/upgrade for some tweaks. To update you have to run this command:apt-get upgrade And once more, you have you to type y/n to procced.DPKG. What is it?If you have your *.deb file from 5th step and you want to install it you can do this multiple ways but I am gonna talk only 2 of them.Install it via iFile / Filza. Just navigate to directory where is your file and just tap on it and app will automatically install it. You should respring after installing (killall -9 SpringBoard)Installing via dpkg. This tool is an *.deb package manager. You can use apt-get and aptitude for installing local files too.Just simple navigate in terminal / ssh to directory and rundpkg
