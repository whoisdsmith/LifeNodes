"Perhaps we ought to ask, in what direction do we want to move in? You can be filled with bitterness and with hatred...and a desire for revenge...or we can make effort to comprehend and replace that violence, that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land with an effort to understand compassion and love." The great JFK

Make amends and find courage to be free of the demons that keep your past intact. Tell someone you care about that you love them, tell them before it's too late. Today could be their last day or yours and if one of you must go, make sure they know they are loved. That is all.

I started writing again but this time it's not about all the negativity, it's about slowly finding myself and focusing on a better future. Music has always sang through my blood and kept the rhythm in my feet to lead me down each new path, but then the day came when I could no longer hear the melodies or feel the tempo in my heart and I knew that I had taken all the wrong paths. I woke up yesterday to my stomach playing symphonies and In that moment I knew that the girl laying next to me had somehow cured my deafness. Isn't it funny what paths music lead you to?

Everyone will die, and everyone will lose
So what you going to do with the moments you have before it's you?
It doesn't mean goodbye
It's just a simple truth
The shedding of a lifetime of layers that once embodied you
Like winter into spring and summer into fall
The cycle of intense introspection before the curtain call
Cause everyone must die and everyone must lose
So who you going to love in the meantime before it catches you?

It's very rare when you meet someone who cares more about others then themselves, but even on her birthday Stevie Marie Linnabary is more interested and concerned with me then with herself and the fact that it's her day. She inspires me to be better and to believe that good things do happen and that not all people suck. We've come a long way from that parking lot where we had our first kiss, to the nights we spent fighiting over who cared about who the most, to being stubborn and pretending not to care. The truth is you are the best woman that I will ever have and if I can grow old and treat people the way you do than I might finally get to call myself a good man, you deserve a lot more but I'm so thankful you stick around and love me

## 2012-09-10T05:01:00.000Z - Dont Know what Im Gonna Tell Everett about His Little Brother. This is what Keeps Me Awake through the Night. 32 Weeks Old and He Was Beautiful. To Some People 8 Months Isn't long Enough to Get Attached to Anything, but I Spent Everyday Talking and Playing Music to that Boy till He'd either Summersault into a Dance off or Would Calm Himself back to Sleep. The Hardest part is Him not Kickin Me Anymore. I Spent a Lot of time with Him when He Was in the Womb. Now I Spend a Lot of time a Bit Lost but Thank God for Stevie Friends and Family

## 2012-12-24T00:02:45.000Z - Sometimes I'm Hard to Handle. Most of the Time. And a Lot of Things I Say to You Are Unnecessary. I Know that I Have a Problem with Myself that I Take out on You. I Will Work on that Though. Because Ever since I Met You, I Have Had This Gut Feeling that You Were More than just a Guy Who Was Lost and Was Hurt Too much to Care. When You Came through Kmart All the time I Would Get Butterflies and My Face Would Turn Red. You Made Me Feel Things I'd Never Felt Before! Then I Knew that it Was Wrong to Talk to You with Those Feelings, so I Stopped, but Always Thought of You. Then Finally the time Came when I Was Able to Be More than a Friend to You, and I Was Scared. What if I Messed Up, Said Something Stupid. Wasn't Good Enough. But We Fell in Love and Sometimes I Forget how much it Means. I'm not just Some Girl Who You Fooled around With. You Chose Me to Have a Family With. Yes You Had other Girls, but I Was the One Who Won Your Heart after so Many Broke It. And I'm an Idiot for Forgetting This as Often as I Do. I Took a risk in Being with You and You've Done Nothing to Prove to Me that You Are an Amazing Father, Husband, and Friend.. You Are Stubborn Yes, but You Are Faithful and no One is Perfect, Especially not Me. Just Know that I Love You and This Bond We Have is Something I Never Ever want to Lose. I'd Be so Lost and Unhappy without You. I Will Try until I Take My Last Breath, Til Death Do Us Part. I Can't Wait to Be Your Mrs Smith. I Love You so much Dustin, Don't Ever Forget it

Stevie
