Me (1:32 PM)

Hey it's Dustin this is my new # I got back on my Verizon plan, so I am no longer on a plan with you on boost.

Me (2:10 PM)

You ain't gotta block me, my mom filled me in on the divorce shit and that she had a talk with you about not hanging around here or with me anymore. I'm moving on from that life with you forever and I will never come back to you. I'd tell you to do the same but I think you know we can't repair the damage we've done and I don't want to. I allow it to set me back every time and all I'm trying to do is rebuild my life not re redestroy it. I won't message you unless it's about the girls. There is a better life without each other I've seen it and lived it and you can too. See you at 6

Stevie Marie (4:24 PM)

Me (7:03 AM)

Me (5:38 PM)

You're a douche for letting Lydia watch It 2.

Stevie Marie (5:39 PM)

She didn't. I did. She walked in and saw 2 seconds of it, asswipe. Mind your business.

Me (5:39 PM)

She said she watched all of it, it is my business ya cunt

Me (5:40 PM)

Me (5:41 PM)

You're so fucking fake it's ridiculous.

## 2020-01-10T19:28:00.000Z - ------ Friday, Jan 10, 2020 ------

Me (4:11 AM)

Sorry for the name calling I'm really trying to be a better person. Drug free me is quite the character. I am clean and been clean, I go back to work next week, Adderall free and meth free. I see shit so much clearly. The drugs were definitely what kept me in the loop with you cause without them I don't know why I ever felt I couldn't do any better. I may not be much right now living at my mom's and shit but I'm gonna be all the shit u wish I would've been with you but never let me be who I truly am so you only got what you made me into

Me (4:17 AM)

Oh and I'm gonna get to where I'm going without no big ass tax payout for a new car or a new place. Yea I'll actually work for it without the tax break from OUR children cause I worked 11 out of 12 months last year and I helped more than I ever have with the girls so you can say what you want when your swimming in all that fucking money that I should have a right to as well but I earned some it too but you'll never do the right thing when you're with that cheating sack of shit. So Merry Christmas I'm glad I could give you 2 out the 3 best gifts you'll ever have

Me (6:25 AM)

I'm all for staying right the fuck out of your business I don't give a fuck what you do, who you do or how shity your life is, but when your neighbors tell me they can hear you fighting all the way down to their house well I'm sure glad I have the girls this week but I assume you have Cam and I'm sure Corey would not like to hear the shit I just heard. And to be a little honest I'm glad nothing's changed you made this help for yourself and I want you to live it cuz that's what you deserve but let me hear someone else tell me they heard you fighting all the way down the road on the weeks you do have my girls then we're going to have a fucking problem you can use the Meth shit all you want but I'm fucking clean and I'll go get tested twice a week just a fucking spit in your face. Every fucking time this happens I always tell you there's a better way to handle the situation then the way you fucking handle it. You went to great lengths personally be a bitch to me this time around and to make me into this awful person if you think I'm going to forget it this time you're wrong. I highly suggest the next time you talk to me you keep the bullshit remarks in the name calling out of it or I will tell Corey and we will have bigger problems and I don't want any of that cuz I want you to be right where you're at and be fucking miserable (Delivered)

Me (2:28 PM)

I start back at MEC next week are you going to help me get Lydia to school or no

## 2020-01-13T03:35:00.000Z - ------ Sunday, Jan 12, 2020 ------

Me (4:55 PM)
TA at 6

Me (6:29 PM)
Smelled like weed so bad, just saying

Me (6:53 PM)
I told Lydia if she and Rayna wanna come over when you and Tyler are fighting to have you call me and I'll come get them. They don't need to be around that shit anymore. If you guys don't wanna get your shit together at least don't put the girls through it. I mean it, this is the first time Lydia didn't wanna go back to you. I been a better dad off the drugs so that could be why too but if you get to fighting please call me. I won't hold it against you but I will respect you if you call me to get them

## 2020-01-15T03:36:00.000Z - ------ Tuesday, Jan 14, 2020 ------

Me (5:58 PM)
Hey will you please tell the girls I'm thinking of them and I love and miss them

## 2020-01-15T21:31:00.000Z - ------ Wednesday, Jan 15, 2020 ------

Me (4:31 PM)

Hey I started working at MEC again, are you going to be able to help me get Lydia to and from school? I'm working 6-330 next week

Me (5:36 PM)
I am and have been clean and sober, not even going to get my Adderall rx back I had a doc appointment setup for Monday but I canceled it cause I finally conquered those demons and you're the one I have to thank for that shit so thank you for helping me live a better life and be the man I've always wanted to be

Me (5:38 PM)
At least you did one good thing for me out of this joke of a marriage. So glad it's over, you ain't even got a clue how much better you made my life by removing yourself from it

Me (5:39 PM)
You were worse than any drug and I've finally conquered all of my addictions.

Stevie Marie (2:44 PM)

Can you watch the girls at 4 so i can play pool and I'll take them for you tomorrow

Me (2:49 PM)

Yea can you drop them off

Stevie Marie (3:27 PM)

Yes on my way

Me (3:32 PM)

Ok

Me (7:04 PM)

I really need you to get Lydia to and from school for me please. There's no reason we can't work together for our daughters happiness. I put all that shit with me and you long behind me. I'm clean and sober from the Adderall and the meth and I'm never going backwards or back to anything that involves that negative shit. You can say all you want about me but actions will show you Im changing and all I want is peace love and happiness and we both know that will never come from you so please just help me and I'll help you.

## 2020-01-21T04:20:00.000Z - ------ Monday, Jan 20, 2020 ------

Me (12:10 PM)

So can I drop Lydia off at 515 in the mornings please?

Me (12:16 PM)

I'll take the girls at 4 on Sundays and drop them off after pool when it's your Sunday you help me I help you I'm not seeing what the problem is here

Stevie Marie (3:08 PM)

Can i just have the girls during the week it would just be easier that way

Stevie Marie (3:09 PM)

You will still need to pay for your daycare week and help me with food and gas having them but its too much stress to be trading them on and off for a whole week and its hell on them.

Me (4:40 PM)

I don't know what to do here

Me (4:41 PM)

My mom said she needs every other weekend off and I don't want to go back to just bring a weekend dad

Me (4:57 PM)

Do you really feel the girls don't deserve to see me?

Me (5:08 PM)

Well seems how I don't have a choice in this manner because I have no one or no way to get her to Homer can you come get them tonight I don't have a vehicle right now

Me (5:14 PM)

You're just trying to fuck me over and I don't understand why?? Why haven't you done enough damage and fucked me over enough why do you feel I keep fucking deserve this shit

Me (5:17 PM)

This is all your fault, it's all on you and your actions why am I the one being punished for them?!

Me (5:18 PM)

You didn't want me regardless of the meth bullshit, you didn't want me at all, so why am I being punished?!

Me (5:19 PM)

I tried to be the bigger person yesterday and help you out and this is how you repay me?

Me (5:20 PM)

We both know that this because of Tyler's little fucking crybaby ass. Cause it wasn't an issue when you were at Cory's. I thought the children always come first?! They never do when you're with that fucking loser

Me (5:21 PM)

All I'm trying to do is move on with my life. I don't want you and I never will again so what's the fucking problem? I won't be rekindling our relationship behind his back cause you two fucking deserve each other and I want you both to be fucking miserable

Me (5:22 PM)

I'm sorry I'm fucking pissed but you gave me no fucking heads up and YOU told my mom I could drop her off on my weeks

Me (5:26 PM)

I will find transportation for Lydia but until I do she will be going to Heather's since you don't want to fucking help me for OUR daughters sake

Me (5:26 PM)

I will call Homer school and let them know that she will not be there until I can find transportation

Me (5:27 PM)

that doesn't make me a shity father since I had no heads up cuz the last I knew you were going to take her for me your words to my mother

Me (5:29 PM)

You want to be pissed off go be pissed off at your jealous little bitch of a boyfriend. Take it out on him. I'm done with both of your jealous bullshit when I was MORE than willing to help you out

Me (5:55 PM)

I got it figured out you can pick the girls up at 4 on Sunday since you dropped them off at 4 please other than that I don't need or want to hear from you. I tried to help you but you want to be difficult and go back on your word so be it

Stevie Marie (6:28 PM)

You'll get your ass put in jail doing spme bullshit like that. She needs to be in school unless you want truancy officers at your door. This has nothing to dp with tyler. I cannot keep making extra trips and meeting up with you disrupting everyones day, why cant i just have them during the weekdays it makes it much easier???

Me (6:29 PM)

Done talking

Stevie Marie (6:30 PM)

You dont want to be a weekend dad, then i giess you should make arrangements. I have changed my schedule to be able to do what i need to do for my kids. Work fucking 3rd shift, do what it takes. You dont just get to drag them around because you look at her education like its an inconvenience. Its not. Do what it takes or i can just take them on the weekdays.

Me (6:32 PM)

I said I got it figured out, daycare in homer for both girls is 300 on my week I fucking got it taken care of now leave me the fuck alone

Me (6:36 PM)

You told my mom you told the judges assistant it would be your responsibility since I couldn't change schools

Me (6:36 PM)

Just saying

Me (6:37 PM)

You don't even have a sitter now since you can't pay her

Me (6:38 PM)

I'll do whatever it takes don't worry

Me (6:39 PM)

This is all your fault your the one who keeps changing your mind and making the girls go back and forth. Dumbass

Me (6:40 PM)

Anyways I don't need your help. I'm done talking and negotiating with a terrorist

Me (6:40 PM)

You will pick them up at 4 on Sunday though

Me (6:42 PM)

And you WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE YOUR OWN CARSEATS

Me (6:42 PM)

See you then

Me (7:17 PM)

How come I have not received any court papers yet? I have nothing in writing saying I can't switch Lydia schools. I have her birth certificate and her ss# btw

Me (7:24 PM)

Why you gotta make this so difficult? This is all your fault, I didn't switch up on you, you switched up on me and went back on your word. That's on you not me

Me (7:25 PM)

I thought eve...

## 2020-01-22T03:40:00.000Z - ------ Tuesday, Jan 21, 2020 ------

Stevie Marie (4:58 PM)

I dont have her carseat

Stevie Marie (4:58 PM)

And im at the doc With

Me (5:41 PM)

Sorry I've been in meetings with all the doctors and the head of Bronson. I am the only next of kin for my dad who can make decisions for him. He had a massive stroke at 11 this morning they found a blood clot in his brain and got it out but he is can't follow basic commands or communicate very well. He can't eat or swallow his brain isn't telling him to do shit right. It sucks. I'm sorry about the carseat they told me they couldn't do the surgery without my consent so I was rushing up here and they ended up doing the surgery anyways. Can you keep the girls tonight and get Lydia to and from school and get Rayna to daycare? I have to go to work tomorrow so I can get Rayna from daycare and pick Lydia up afterwards

Stevie Marie (5:43 PM)

Alright that works

Me (8:24 PM)

Would my dad be in good hands if he were to go to Marshall Nursing and rehab

Me (8:25 PM)

It's gonna be up to me to figure out where he goes for rehab and care for the next month or two

Me (8:28 PM)

Nevermind that's just gonna start a whole bunch of bullshit and drama that I want no part of, I'll find somewhere else for him

Me (8:34 PM)

No offense, I was just thinking about the best care for my dad and I know you're good at what you do I didn't realize the conflict it could and would cause if he was there

## 2020-01-25T03:32:00.000Z - ------ Friday, Jan 24, 2020 ------

Me (3:11 PM)

Hey did u get Lydia from school

Stevie Marie (3:13 PM)

No im getting her from the bus in a couple mins

Me (3:15 PM)

Ok Im almost to tekonsha, do you wanna drop her off and I'll give you your money or how u wanna do this

Stevie Marie (3:19 PM)

Can u swing by the bus stop? Im going there now

Me (3:20 PM)

So you want me to get her from the bus then yes

Stevie Marie (3:21 PM)

Well idk if you'll be there in time we're going there now if u go that way u can stop too to get her and do the money

Me (10:25 PM)

You know ever since I got off the drugs, I've been nothing but a better father, yeah I'm more strict than I was before cause I don't let them walk all over me and when they fuck up I let em know it. I don't yell and get angry anymore but I don't give in to their demands either. Lydia said she was gonna sneak out and go to your house tonight and I don't know wtf is so cool about you, you're the reason she has a broken family not me but if she wanna stay with you she can fucking stay with you. She's gonna grow up to be just like you anyways it's inevitable, I'd rather she break my heart and cut me out of her life now than in 10 years anyways

Me (10:28 PM)

I don't hate you, I just wish you would have let me move on with my life 3 years ago instead of dragging me into your bullshit love triangle.

Me (10:30 PM)

I really hope you got the ball rolling for the divorce cause I got a letter in the mail saying it was gonna be dismissed due to inactivity. I don't want to be married to you anymore you need to get rid of my last name for the benefit of all of us cause I'm ashamed as hell when people find out I'm married to you

Me (10:32 PM)

I wish you would move to Washington or to a fucking new country

## 2020-01-26T03:44:00.000Z - ------ Saturday, Jan 25, 2020 ------

Stevie Marie (10:13 AM)

I am filing more paper work so I have have legal custody. So unless you wanna walk up in there and agree on that with me then its gonna be a little while until its finalized because im NOT letting your mental instability interfere with my children or their education.

Stevie Marie (10:14 AM)

If you can send me your income your w2 or something then i can do the rest of the paperwork.

Me (12:31 PM)

I'll go up and agree with whatever speeds up the process

Me (12:33 PM)

There's nothing mentally unstable about what I said to you. It's the truth

Me (12:35 PM)

You played me for 3 years straight cause Tyler didn't want you. It's fact

Me (12:35 PM)

You're the only one who can't admit that

Me (12:36 PM)

You never tried, you never cared you did the bare minimum until he wanted you again and that's wrong

Me (12:36 PM)

I can only hope he does the same to you one day

Me (12:38 PM)

But rest assured I won't ever fall for your manipulation again and the next time you want to move out cause it's not a good environment for the kids im gonna make sure that's where you stay cause that's what you chose and the girls have to suffer cause of it, than that's on you

Me (3:11 PM)

I also told the board at Bronson that I would like him to go to Marshall Nursing and rehabilitation, if that's gonna be a conflict of interest between you and Tyler I guess you'll have to find a new job

Why on God's green earth would I ever help you go have fun when it's your time if you weren't gonna help me in return? I'm never gonna do you any favors without getting something in return.

Me (9:45 PM)
Just need to know if I need to find a way to get Lydia to school, since I can't put her in Marshall, you demanded she goes to Homer than it's your responsibility to get her there especially when you have to take cam every day anyways. You're not going out of your way to do anything extra for me by doing something you're already doing anyways.

Stevie Marie (9:48 PM)
You would need to give me gas money sunday because regardless of cam im taking them during your time. And waking up way earlier every single day. And i need you to bring her here in the AM not heathers.

## 2020-03-04T23:17:20.000Z - Stevie and I Had Our Last Court Hearing for the Divorce. Its Officially Final

## 2020-03-06T16:37:01.000Z - Stevie and I Applied for an Apartment together than Went out to Applebees. I Told My Mom We Were Going to Move in together

## 2020-03-07T16:38:17.000Z - Had to Work 6-10 This Morning. Stevie Seems Distant, Says She's Dealing with Tyler Shit. Trying not to Relive Old Feelings and Trying not to Have Doubt Shit is Hard, so much Harder than the Adderall and Meth Withdrawal Was. Guess Its just One More Thing I Need to Learn how to Conquer. On a Positive Note I Have My Road Test Today to Get My License Back. Almost Officially an Adult Again

## 2020-03-08T02:00:50.000Z - 2020-03-07-090000

Passed my road test and got my certificate.

Stevie picked me and the girls up and took richard to buy a motorcycle.

Than she came over for awhile, we sang and listened to music. Everything seems really awkward. I feel like shes trying really hard to try and show any affection, to the point where shes making herself try and have feelings she no longer has anymore. I don't know, I feel too much she doesn't seem to feel anything. I wish we had our own money and were financially stable without each other cause only than would I really know if she wanted me or not.

## 2020-05-29T22:10:36.000Z - My Fate

I see it every day
Every day
that look on your face
Telling me I'm just a waste
But I can't escape this place

I Can't out run my fate
I know my heart broke
In so many ways
I Can't out run my fate
I know my heart broke
In so many ways

No hope I'm a lost cause
No joke all I gots flaws
Going through withdrawal
Demons start to crawl
Now I'm getting lost
Tell me what's it cost

What's it cost?
Why'd you leave?
I don't wanna go
But I'm gone
I'm done
playing games
I'm gone
no more pain

No more pain
All you brought me was the hurt
And every word you said a lie
It's all a lie

## 2020-05-29T22:17:40.000Z - Born into a Warzone

Since day one all you know
Try hard to let go
But it still shows
And it grabs hold
Of your little soul
screaming daddy come home
Don't leave us alone

War paint on your face
I see it and I want to look away
Fucks me up every day
I wish it was different
I wish it would change

## 2020-05-29T22:22:34.000Z - Oh now Youre Callin?

Acting like you really wanna talk and
Acting like I'm somebody you want and
But you were never good at being honest

Cause I'm always second best
Now all I do is second guess

These days I been growin heartless
Wont fuck with you no I'm not retarded
Cause I know exactly where your heart is
With that other bitch there's no restartin

Tore my heart out my chest
Left my life in such a mess
I confess yea I got nothing left but regrets
Sad to say that we were never meant
So I guess that it's best I just forget

## 2020-05-29T22:38:37.000Z - Last Year I Lost a War to the Darknes

Got my heart broke now I'm heartless
Fell into the drugs all I got was madness
Empty nights all alone with my sadness
I put you on blast became a has been
Or a never was cause I guess I never was
What I could have been what I should have been

## 2020-05-29T22:38:57.000Z - Why Am I so Sad

Always so mad
I don't miss love
But I really miss the drugs

Cause at least I felt somethin
Now all I feel is nothing
Now my ghost haunting
Put me in a coffin
I don't give a fuck and
I'm a die alone
So bitter and cold
Guess Better on my own

Close the door and go
Leave me all alone
Stab me in the back
Never come back home

You rich and now I'm broke
You tuned me to a joke
On my words now imma choke
I wish we never spoke

I hope you're happy
Cause right now I'm just done
Actin so fuckin tough and
Just wanna say fuck it
I don't wanna do this anymore

## 2020-05-29T22:41:53.000Z - Shorty Tryna Call

Guess she wanna talk
I'm busy with my homies
We chilled at the mall
So She sends me a pic
With Just her in her bra
And If I come over
Than I can have it all

She says the doors unlocked
My clothes are off
"I'll give you top,
I'll be your thot"
And I won't stop
Till I get you off
I can't get enough
You're my greatest fuck

Aww yeah we gon

Guess you c an fuck off
I'm heading to the club

## 2020-05-29T22:44:37.000Z - Damn You Got Me Feeling Low

Knife in the back what a blow
Now my heart growin cold
All that love done turned to stone

I used to be gold
I used to have goals
I used to have hope
Now you think I'm a joke

All this pain inside my brain
Has got me so fucked up
Replacing love with all the drugs
Seems it's not enough
Is fucking me up I'm not okay

I used to have a home

So full of hope

an old soul
Searching for somebody to hold
And build a home

## 2020-05-29T23:31:14.000Z - Stimulant

10 years on a stimulant
Once felt like my favorite drug
Now I feel insignificant
60 mg just isn't enough

times are tough
life is rough
been losing love

been losing trust
Don't give a fuck

Since they cut me off
Might as well have
pulled the plug
Might as well
have put a gun
Up to my dome
And shot it off

Sick of not feeling that rush
I'm an addict for that crack shit

feel like I'm always stuck
my demons tell me to give up

## 2020-05-29T23:31:33.000Z - Fuck These Feelings

I'm way past grieving
Your lies deceiving
My head still high
Way up towards the ceiling

Fuck your sorrys
You were never sorry
Maybe that one time
Oh wait yea right hardly

Telling me I ain't shit
And that he's more of a man
than ill ever admit
Fuckin yeah right
All he is, is a bitch
just a bigger dick
So go and sit
fuck you hoe
I'm done with this
Fuck you know
Bout honest lips
Honestly you are not shit
I'm
But a fake ass bitch
Go shake them hips
Around someone elses dick
You make me sick
On that sinkin ship
Get a grip on
And go fuck yourself you stupid bitch

## 2020-05-29T23:32:04.000Z - There's Something Wrong with Me

They say I'm ADD
Guess I'm a disease

Every day
hard to face
myself In the mirror
I just look away
I fuckin hate
That I became
such a waste
The drugs took everything
Took my money,
And The good inside me
Till I was nothing
Can't you see
That I just keep running
I do anything
To
When I just wanted to feel nothing
Now the shit just haunts me
And I'm sorry mom, I'm sorry son
I'm sorry to my girls I've come undone

## 2020-05-29T23:33:20.000Z - And even after All

the hell we been through
I'm still down for you
I'd still die for you
I'd take a bullet straight
through my heart for you
you know it's true
even when you leave me blue
feeling worthless and used

You left me on read
Left me a mess
Rather be dead

## 2020-05-29T23:34:08.000Z - Return to Sender

My heart you buried.
Grave stone found in the cemetery
So hateful
Gotta stay low
Wit a plate full
You ungrateful
You the Same hoe
Friend now a foe
Hard to let go
Some shits just hard to swallow
But I will not follow
You down to the hollows
Cause your soul it swallows
And I just want to get out
So sick of all the bullshit
I think I found my way out
I Left you in your bullshit
And I don't want you to drown
But you chose this for yourself now

Shot through the heart
Stabbed in the back
Don't care where you are

Ungrateful
Platef

And all the shit you say
You murdered me

## 2020-05-29T23:34:29.000Z - Safe to Say I'm on My way Yeah

Fuck your negative shit
Get out my fucking way bitch
All you do is hate
Make me go irate
Add more problems to my plate
Please Stay the fuck away

Fuck a hatchet
I got me some matches
Imma burn this mother fucker down
Till there ain't nothing left but ashes
Bodies in the caskets
My shit they'll be blastin

You're so cold you turned your own heart into frost

I'm trying to be on my best behavior
But you got me feeling like a hater

I woke up to the snow falling on the rooftop
Another year has passed and I know it won't stop
I tried to change, tried to behave,
tried to escape but it's all the same

This year for Christmas
All I want is to be Jolly
So if you're into buying
Please just get me some Molly

Two years ago
I was alone
wishing santa would
answer the fucking phone
but he's a hoe
for going ghost
so here's a toast
you fuckin bloke
Now it's my show
I stole your coat
Next it'll be your soul
Don't mean to gloat
But I am now the goat

Merry Christmas to you that's

and fuck your elves
up on the shelves
ring the bells
Get Rudolph high as hell

## 2020-05-29T23:35:07.000Z - Back in the Day

Had so much to say
To that beautiful face
It was a steady pace
It Wasn't a race
there wasn't a chase
No worries about anyone
takin my place
times they have changed
Now I'm a disgrace
Somebody that you now
try and erase
But you can't escape
How you became fake
Chose him over me
Now I am replaced
By someone who wont
love you the same
That's what you get
I was never to blame
Your love was a game
I never wanted to play
Cause I got played
And that's not okay
fuck what you say
Your words full of hate
Now it's too late
You chose your fate
I hope that you stay
Forever away.
That would be great
I'll say it again
Stay the fuck away
Your words breed hate

## 2020-05-30T03:35:07.000Z - I just Wanted You to Know

it's not your fault
Just put me in the ground
watch me dissolve
It's all my fault
All my fault
I'm sorry that I'm filled
With all these flaws

It's one of those days where I feel like I'm drowning and every time I try to catch a breath of air, the undertow pulls me right back down from all the shit inside my head that;s weighing me down.the weight of all the shit inside my head just can't keep me afloat.Up ahead, and I know I'm getting closer because the ocean is getting more shallow I continue swimming towards it, I'm so tired and exhausted from fighting the constant current that's in my way, especially when it's so much easier to just stop and let the current take me in the other direction, so that I can rest my eyes and my thoughts and scream that I don't give a fuck and just be done, but that's not who I am. I've fought for so long to hold on to the things that have long let me go. It's who I am, I don't believe in giving up on the things or the people that I love,

I can see dry land and the island that's full of all the good and the beautiful things in my life

## 2020-10-16T23:57:30.394Z - Hey

Listen a lot has happened in the last few days. I've been to places mentally that I don't like to go but I had to go there to be able to get the fuck out of bed every day. I feel like I'm getting to that point of not giving a fuck and I want to keep giving a fuck.

I fear that I will never make it out of my mom's with this job and with my license situation. I can't move forward without some kind of miracle or some outside help. I'm not putting that outside help on you either. I'll never make you carry my weight ever again.

I know you are cursed with not being able to forget anything, especially the bad things, I guess I'm cursed with being able to forget a lot of things or maybe I'm not forgetting them but actually letting those wounds heal because I choose to live through those things instead of hiding them or running from them. I don't know.

I never wanted to lose you and I never wanted you to lose yourself. We have been through so much together, more than most people have their entire lives, both good and bad. I don't see a way of us getting out of our situations without something life changing or altering happening and the only conclusion or solution I have is to let you go. Despite all my feelings, all my love, how sick it makes me to not be with you, I know that I am the only one who can break us out of this loop so you can be the person and the mother you really want to be.

I don't want to let you go Stevie. I told you back when we first got together that I just knew you were it for me. There's nobody after you and I mean it now just as I did then, if not more. I want you to be able to have a better life for yourself and for the girls and I know the only way that is possible is to be able to have a clean slate and fresh start with someone whom you can build a new life with.

All I am or have become to you is either a reminder of how much I hurt you back than and how it's my fault I made you who you are now or I'm just going to be a constant reminder of all of your mistakes and you will never escape this cycle of doom. I don't see any happy endings for myself because this isn't what I want but I'm finally putting the wants and needs of you and the children before my own for once.

I don't know how we're going to get through this at all, I can't hardly function as it is, but I do know that every time the dust settles, even after only a few days. That law of attraction goes into full effect and it keeps pulling us back in. I would continue this loop forever if It means that every few months I get to see you and be with you for just one more day over and over but I have to stop being so selfish of what I want. We are both more than our mistakes and I would do anything and everything thing I could to right my wrongs for you.

I'm not going to play it off like I'm not hurt for the things that's happened the last few months, especially when I've been trying to go 💯 on the fact that I just wanted you to be real and be honest with me regardless of my feelings. Maybe I could have found a way to save us if I knew how you really felt about me and what you really felt about Tyler. You are a good person stevie, who makes mistakes just like everyone else. And I know after you got with Tyler you thought you were doing the right thing because it was different and you didn't want to throw our marriage away for something that wasn't real and concrete in your soul. I also know you hated the way you went about things and kept coming back to repair them so you could feel like you were doing the right thing. I don't ever want to be someone you want for any other reason accept because that's what you really want. None of that because it was familiar and comfortable shit, or you felt bad or guilty for me. Fuck that, all that shit did was fuck me up even more cause it just made me question how you felt about me even more.

I don't know where to go or what to do anymore all I know is I have to find any and every way to stay out of your life and leave you alone so you can move on and be happy

## 2020-10-16T23:59:02.567Z - Untitled New Song

This goes out to all those who are brokenand to the lost souls who ain't got no hope in emAnd for those who's words always go unspokenIm always here to listen guess that's why I'm chosenThis is for anybody contemplating taking their lifeWondering if anyone gives a shit if they dieCause I know exactly what that shit feels likeBack in August I was at that point and tried to end mineAnd all you wanna do is cry and get highCause you can't stand going to bed alone at nightAnd the ghosts of what haunts you the most take flightand you try and go to the safest place in your mindbut all the doors are locked from the other side.

Just hear me out, I'm here to guide you nowI know you're feeling down promise I won't let you drown just hear my sounds and you will be found

I'm nothing special, I grew up on punk and metalNever got into trouble till I tried to sell my soul for someone I loved to the devil

That's when my heart and mind got all fucked upFell into lust, got into drugs but none of it was enoughI'll never know why people you love hurt you so much

I needed a remedy so I turned all my pain into melodies and All those memories into harmoniesAnd I make all these beats out of my tragedies

I'm not a saint but I have a heart of gold that I won't let anyone take that away from me, you can cut me up and fuck me up and I'll still love you when you've had enough

Maybe it's a curse or maybe I just connected with the wrong people on this Earth and because of that I lost my self worth cause I don't remember what it's like not to hurt

I may not be in your shoes but I know how it feels to be used and mentally abused and without further doI'd like to welcome you to a better life if you choose.

## 2020-10-16T23:59:34.152Z - Isn't it Ironic that I Gave up My Dreams for Youand when You Fucked Me over and Left with no Closure

my dreams start coming true?

I guess in some fucked up way I should thank you,but It's really hard when all I want is to hate you.

You're the reason I lost so much of myself,

the reason I had to reach out and get help

after you put me through all that hell,

and yea I say "I still wish you well"

but I cant lie like you, can't you tell?

So good riddance, bye Felicia, adios assholeGet back to playing your role of the outstanding hoe

Ive been so busy with my new life I forget to remind you that you're a foe, but I'm sure that you already know

Send my gratitude to my cousin you fucked back in juneand probably every month when I was with you

told you I was gonna haunt you, I'm a constant reminder of all your lies when it comes to the truth

and when it comes to Tyler I know hes the best person for you, a lying piece of shit just like you, you both make me sick like the worst kind of flu. So yeah I'm still wishing you well, like straight into hell,

what a great example you are to our daughters

## 2020-10-17T00:00:35.274Z - Things for You to Read when I'm Dead and Gone

It's so hard not to be angry with you. It's so hard to do anything without you. You hurt me so much and you don't even care that you did it on purpose and what have I done to you these last 2 years when we've been together? Nothing! All my mistakes came from years ago and all I did was my best to not repeat them and I didn't! I never would have! I really hope you're miserable with Tyler and that he makes you into a raging alcoholic until you drown in it enough to finally realize what you did to me and maybe one day you'll FINALLY be sorry for all of it, because you aren't nor have you ever been sorry or you wouldn't have done this shit over and over just because I am fucking struggling to get on my feet. Word of advice don't ever get married unless it's to Tyler and you both can die together miserably.

Forever unlove

Your Ex-husband

So if you leave me babe
I won't die the same
So if you leave me babe
I'll be the one to blame

Verse
I just want my words to matter
To inspire hope and a little laughter
Maybe one day get that happy ever after
For now I’m at the bottom tryna climb the ladder

Been out here on my own
Grinding all alone
Trying to get my shit together
write the perfect flow
I just wanted you to know
That I’m trying to let go
Still trying to find myself
As I’m learning how to grow
And all That pain and sadness
Ain’t ever trying to show
Spent way too many nights
Living like Im on death row
And Now my only goal
turn that sorrow into gold
And Light up the whole room
When I walk in because I glow

I never wanna feel this way again
So low so low so low

Everything good will someday end
Ya know ya know ya know

Verse
Here I go all alone
I’m doing fine all on my own
Don’t need you anymore
just some music and my phone
My hearts grown cold

Cruisin in my fusion
Won’t stop cause I’m not losin
Anymore of myself to anybody else now
Nobody’s gonna let me down again

I won’t lie, or deny
l still think about my wife late at night
and wonder what our life would be like
if she had just fought to try
but it doesn’t even matter
cause the life we had is over
I just hope that she knows
That I always fucking loved her
And no one came before her
Cause I always adored her
but now I must move forward

I was so sad
I was so broken
Wish I could go back

But I was so mad
Over shitty words spoken
Now I leave it in the past

Cause I'm Not taking anymore time
To rewind everything in my life
Cause I’m going in forward motion
Won’t stop till I get where I'm going

## 2020-10-18T18:14:02.000Z - REPAER

I don't remember who I was back then
Before the darkness came and never left
Cause who I am now is worse than death
I am the cold air that shivers from your breath
The reason your eyes glow red
When you're angry and upset up
I won't let you forget
I am your biggest regrets
I am your silhouette
When the darkness
comes to collect
On all your unpaid debt
I am the reaper
you just don't know it yet

And somewhere along the way
I lost myself to all the hate
And all the pain
I turned it all into
Everything I became

## 2020-10-18T18:14:36.000Z - The Letters We'll Never Send

At this point in life I'm a 35 year old single father of 3 beautiful children. Currently trying to rebuild my life after a heartbreaking divorce and a meth addiction. There are so many reasons why I am where I am, some are simply because of misfortune and things out of my control but most were honestly my fault.

At a young age we develop certain senses of wrong and right, good and bad and so on. My life has always been run by emotions, my moods and my choices always stem from whatever emotion I am feeling at those times.

In 2008 I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on Adderall by 2012 I was on the maximum dosage of 60 mg a day. That drug was my lifeline, it made me into a completely different person, it made me dive head first into my passion of creating music and thrive in every work environment I was in. It got me promoted to jobs I never would have been interested in before, I was making money I had never been able to make previously, but it came with a price. The biggest price of them all. It cost me my wife, my children and my friend's. I put all my time and effort into things that really didn't matter at the end of the day, all my attention went to myself and how long can you neglect the people that love and care about you before they give up on you? 6 years was my answer to that. 6 years of neglect to my then wife and to my son and my daughter's, to my friends and family members. I was a recluse. A machine, a robot working only for myself and when everything finally came crashing down, the last person I wnted to blame was myself. I wanted to be angry at everyone else but myself, I wanted crucify those closest, mostly my ex wife. I know she tried to get me to see where I was going wrong and what I was doing wrong. How I was lacking in being a boyfriend, than in being a husband and finally in being a father.

I care so deeply about people yet I lack so much in showing it.

## 2020-10-18T18:15:07.000Z - My Fate

I see it every day
Every day
that look on your face
Telling me I'm just a waste
But I can't escape this place

I Can't out run my fate
I know my heart broke
In so many ways
I Can't out run my fate
I know my heart broke
In so many ways

No hope I'm a lost cause
No joke all I gots flaws
Going through withdrawal
Demons start to crawl
Now I'm getting lost
Tell me what's it cost

What's it cost?
Why'd you leave?
I don't wanna go
But I'm gone
I'm done
playing games
I'm gone
no more pain

No more pain
All you brought me was the hurt
And every word you said a lie
It's all a lie

## 2020-10-18T18:15:26.000Z - Endings Are Hard, Life Changing, Sometimes Life Ending, I Think It's Safe to Say I'll Never Be the Same Person I Was before 2017. Dreams Were Shattered, Love Was Broken, Hope Was Lost. That Fear of Monsters Being Real as a Child Came to Life only Those Monsters Never Came from under the Bed or out of the Closet, They Disguised Themselves in Human Form. They Became the Reason I Never Slept, They Got in My Head and Made Me Question My Self Worth, They Made Me Believe I Would Never Be Anything and I'd Never Be Happy Again. They Made Me Question My Own Life Every Day until I Started Becoming One of Them Myself. My Whole Life I Lived by a Set of Standards and Morals so that I Would Never Cross over to the Dark Side. I Had Boundaries, Lines that I Would Never Cross to Keep Me Safe from Being the next Anakin Skywalker and now I Understand Exactly why He Became Darth Vader because when People You Love Fuck You up and Show You a Side of Themselves and Life that You Never Thought Were Real, it Creates a Catastrophic Chain of Events inside Your Belief System and in the Foundation You've Built Your Life Upon. Love Turned into Pain, Pain Turned into Hate and Hate Turned into Feeling Nothing. What I've Learned is that Hate is not the Greatest Negative Emotion, Feeling Nothing Is, because if You Hate Something It's for a Reason, a Purpose, but to Feel Nothing and Do Things that Hurt People for no Reason, for no Purpose, You Can Really Fuck the World up and far Too Many of Us Feel Nothing Anymore. For a long time I Balanced Myself on All the Lines that I Swore I Would Never Cross and than One by One I Didn't Care Anymore and after Every line I Crossed that Structure and Foundation of Who I once Was Started Caving In. Wall after Wall, Floor after Floor until it Buried Me underneath it and it Wasn't until the Basement Collapsed that I Realized there is no Rock Bottom, There's no Bottom at All to the Holes We Dig for Ourselves, It's Never Ending and You Can just Keep Going until the Consequences of Your Actions and Choices Catch up to You and either Kill You or Mentally Impair You

## 2020-10-18T18:15:52.000Z - Passenger

One thing I've come to realize the most is that our inner demons aren't there to hurt us, they're there to hurt all the people that love us, they take them out one by one until it's just you and them and then they become you. I see it all around me, even in myself. So much darkness, so much anger, so much misunderstanding and all that does is bring those demons to life. They are awaken from hibernation by your surroundings, by the trauma, the environment, anxiety, bad relationships, anything that is negative. You don't have to come from a broken home, you don't have to be abused as a child, they don't just come out because of your childhood, I think that a lot of them probably stem from your childhood but they thrive more in your adulthood because you no longer have that innocence you had as a child to protect you. We are all born with the sense of wrong and right and the ability to be good or bad. It all comes down to a choice, a line drawn between the light and the darkness and once you cross that line you better distance your self from everyone who cares about you because you've just become a ticking time bomb to all of them, but of course it's too late for that cause that good part of you is now permanently in the passenger seat while your demons come to life.

## 2020-10-18T18:16:12.000Z - Where the light Won't Reach You

I Guess it's time to finally admit it's the end
Cause there is no chance for us to ever be again
Too much damage done that you could never mend
And when it comes to you I break instead of bend

You can tell the world how it was all my fault
You can blame me for the death of Jensen blame me for it all
Its just so you feel better and I take the fall
I'll be the villain in our story when you talk

Just remember who was there when you fell apart
Just remember that I always gave you my heart
Just remember that it was me tryna to lead you out the dark
Just remember it was you that lied to me at the start

I just don't get it

I tried to be the light in your dark
But you didn't want to see it
I lit the way with open arms
But you couldn't accept it

tried to commit
tried to transmit
tried to emit,
But you just quit
Let darkness win
Don't give a shit

I'm sorry that
I couldn't save you
I tried my best
but my light won't reach you
I would have stayed
And been lost with you
But you locked me out
And let the darkness take you

There was a time when you could see me
But I gues now you only see right through me
It's like I'm not even here in front of you
There's more to life than the dark that surrounds you

Let me paint you this picture of my mind
Take a seat, listen to me, hard to describe
The horrors trapped inside of me and I am over run by anxiety it gets the best of me and one day maybe it will be the end of me
It's the enemy I can't breathe the dark is right in front of me it's smothering

## 2020-10-18T18:16:35.000Z - Premeditated

Got some shit I want to say
Not sure where I should start at
I will accept all of the blame
Never meant to leave you broken hearted
I wish that we could change
and just go back to when we first started
I hope some day that you'll be ok
When you learn that I have departed

There were lines that got crossed
And shit just got out of hand
So much that we all lost
Things nobody understands

Thought I had it figured out
But found myself in some doubts
There's no going back now
Everything is upside down
I will not be found, no, no, no
I will not be around, no, no, no

There's no going back this time
I think I finally lost my mind
Just want to leave it all behind
And I'll see you in another life

## 2020-10-18T18:17:00.000Z - Born into a Warzone

Since day one all you know
Try hard to let go
But it still shows
And it grabs hold
Of your little soul
screaming daddy come home
Don't leave us alone

War paint on your face
I see it and I want to look away
Fucks me up every day
I wish it was different
I wish it would change

## 2020-10-18T18:17:15.000Z - Backstabber

Straight out the fucking grave I came
I told your ass that I'd be back again for you
someday
And Now their ain't a good damn thing that you can ever say or ever change
Cause the king of death came all this fucking way
Just to make sure your end is filled with pain

And what a shame
you cannot die every day
You are such a waste
your mom made a mistake
yea You nothing but a fuckin fake
Who will be erased without a trace
Now take my place in that grave
And what a shame
you cannot die every day
You are such a waste
your mom made a mistake
yea You nothing but a fuckin fake
Who will be erased without a trace
Now take my place in that grave

I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at and
I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at

I just don't get it
so pathetic
Wont forget it
won't regret it
It's poetic
Fuckin epic
I will not be
Sympathetic
And No need for a medic
Cause It's a fetish
That Got me feeling energetic
Like I'm full of meth and
you guessed it
Im obsessed
With your death
You don't get it
And I won't stop
Until I get it

You can run but you can't hide
Promise you that I will catch up in time
You can run and you can hide
Promise you that I will catch up

It's a death trap
everywhere that I'm at
Everywhere you go
you know that I will follow

You can run but you can't hide
I'm a catch up and it's gon be the end of you
End of you

Cuz I'm not dead
But you're dead
Ill do anything to
get you out my head

I'm a cut you head to toe
And send your soul
straight down to hell

## 2020-10-18T18:17:51.000Z - Oh now Youre Callin?

Acting like you really wanna talk and
Acting like I'm somebody you want and
But you were never good at being honest

Cause I'm always second best
Now all I do is second guess

These days I been growin heartless
Wont fuck with you no I'm not retarded
Cause I know exactly where your heart is
With that other bitch there's no restartin

Tore my heart out my chest
Left my life in such a mess
I confess yea I got nothing left but regrets
Sad to say that we were never meant
So I guess that it's best I just forget

## 2020-10-18T18:18:17.000Z - You're the only One Who Has a Key to My Heart and You Have to either Use it to come back where You Belong or return it to Me so that I May Give it so Someone Else, but You Can no Longer Leave the home I Built inside of Me for You and Take the Key with You. We either Rebuild a Life together or You Forever Vacate Yourself from Me there is no More in Between. I Need the Key back to Your Heart or I Need Closure

## 2020-10-18T18:18:40.000Z - Lost My Heart to the Darkness

Guess that's why I'm heartless
My vessel now a rotting carcus
Stuck between hell and our apartment

Memories on repeat as I drown in defeat
And I can't speak what your name meant to me

All along
was I wrong
Is this
SomeWhere I belong
I am lost
Dead and gone
Was it really
worth the cost

## 2020-10-18T18:19:20.000Z - Last Year I Lost a War to the Darknes

Got my heart broke now I'm heartless
Fell into the drugs all I got was madness
Empty nights all alone with my sadness
I put you on blast became a has been
Or a never was cause I guess I never was
What I could have been what I should have been

## 2020-10-18T18:20:18.000Z - Why Am I so Sad

Always so mad
I don't miss love
But I really miss the drugs

Cause at least I felt somethin
Now all I feel is nothing
Now my ghost haunting
Put me in a coffin
I don't give a fuck and
I'm a die alone
So bitter and cold
Guess Better on my own

Close the door and go
Leave me all alone
Stab me in the back
Never come back home

You rich and now I'm broke
You tuned me to a joke
On my words now imma choke
I wish we never spoke

I hope you're happy
Cause right now I'm just done
Actin so fuckin tough and
Just wanna say fuck it
I don't wanna do this anymore

## 2020-10-18T18:20:50.000Z - Words Left Unsaid

Guess we're dead
You siad it's for the best
And you wish we never meant
Now I just wanna forget

Lately I've been wandering
Aimlessly around on my own
It's dark and cold
Nobody's home
Hate being alone
There's no where to go
Nobody calling on my phone
Loneliness cuts right through me to the bone

Hello God are you there
Do you even still care
I know this shit ain't fair
I only pray when no one's here
I know it's not your fault
I never listen when you talk
I only miss things when they're gone
I know now that I'm wrong

Please guide me in the right direction
I swear this will be my last confession
Please save me from my depression
Cause right now all I want is to end itl

## 2020-10-18T18:21:26.000Z - Safe to Say I'm on My way Yeah

Fuck your negative shit
Get out my fucking way bitch
All you do is hate
Make me go irate
Add more problems to my plate
Please Stay the fuck away

Fuck a hatchet

Imma burn this mother fucker down
Till there ain't nothing left but ashes
Bodies in the caskets
My shit they'll be blastin

## 2020-10-18T18:22:22.000Z - Shorty

Shorty tryna call
Guess she wanna talk
I'm busy with my homies
We chilled at the mall
So She sends me a pic
With Just her in her bra
And If I come over
Than I can have it all

She says the doors unlocked
My clothes are off
"I'll give you top,
I'll be your thot"
And I won't stop
Till I get you off
I can't get enough
You're my greatest fuck

Aww yeah we gon

## 2020-10-18T18:23:27.000Z - Damn You Got Me Feeling Low

Knife in the back what a blow
Now my heart growin cold
All that love done turned to stone

I used to be gold
I used to have goals
I used to have hope
Now you think I'm a joke

All this pain inside my brain
Has got me so fucked up
Replacing love with all the drugs
Seems it's not enough
Is fucking me up I'm not okay

I used to have a home

So full of hope

an old soul
Searching for somebody to hold
And build a home

## 2020-10-18T18:24:22.000Z - Stimulant

10 years on a stimulant
Once felt like my favorite drug
Now I feel insignificant
60 mg just isn't enough

times are tough
life is rough
been losing love

been losing trust
Don't give a fuck

Since they cut me off
Might as well have
pulled the plug
Might as well
have put a gun
Up to my dome
And shot it off

Sick of not feeling that rush
I'm an addict for that crack shit

feel like I'm always stuck
my demons tell me to give up

## 2020-10-18T18:24:42.000Z - Fuck These Feelings

I'm way past grieving
Your lies deceiving
My head still high
Way up towards the ceiling

Fuck your sorrys
You were never sorry
Maybe that one time
Oh wait yea right hardly

Telling me I ain't shit
And that he's more of a man
than ill ever admit
Fuckin yeah right
All he is, is a bitch

So go and sit

But a fake ass bitch
Go shake them hips
Around someone elses dick
You make me sick
On that sinkin ship
Get a grip on
And go fuck yourself you stupid bitch

## 2020-10-18T18:25:20.000Z - Safe to Say

I'm not ok
I'd rather hang
Than feel this way

You could never take my place ok

You see Im carrying this curse
Where I make everything worse
Diggen graves down in the dirt
Got bodies in the hearse
But I make it work
Guess I'm good at what hurts
Always put myself first
Seems I won't ever learn

## 2020-10-18T18:26:20.000Z - Hard to Let Go

Losing control
My heart turning cold
But you'll never know
Guess that's the way that it goes
Lost what mattered the most
Now I'm just a ghost
Who been haunting this home

Just a sad soul with nowhere to go

## 2020-10-18T18:26:51.000Z - Oh She Hit Me with a Text

Always bullshit with this ex
Call me up just for sex
One more reason to regret

When all I want is to forget

You left me dead back in November
Hole in my chest don't you remember
I tried to put myself back together
It's been 3 years and I'm alive in December

You chose your fate
I hope that you stay
Forever away.

## 2020-10-31T12:16:41.214Z -

When I first started this project back in May of 2017, I had no vision or a single song written, I felt that if I had given myself a band name that it would motivate me to play and write music again. I had not touched an instrument in over 4 years and I really didn't even know where to begin. It started off as a slow process not because I couldn't remember how to play but because I had to relearn how to play with 3 fingers instead of four, due to cutting the tip of my middle finger off 2 years ago. That was by far the biggest struggle, plus I didn't have a single instrument because I had sold or given all my stuff away. Thankfully my good friend Alvin loaned me his Telecaster which I still have and still use everyday (I promise I will return it when this record is done buddy!)

It took a solid month before I got back into the swing of writing and playing again but I still had no purpose or direction in which I wanted to go. My life was falling apart at the same time and I just couldn't focus or motivate myself to do anything productive. I managed to write 4 songs from May-August. It wasn't until the end of September when I finally had a vision for this project. Im not your average artist/writer. I write songs to whatever mood Im in and I focus on that. I dont concern myself with song structures and making sure every song has 2 verses, a pre chorus, chorus, bridge, ending and so on and so forth. Whatever Im feeling at that particular point in time is what follows, some songs are a minute and a half long and may not have a standard verse and chorus and some songs are eight to ten minutes long, it just depends on how fucked up emotionally I am when I write. Which brings me to my vision for this project.

Before Anotherlife was created, I was just like any other person out there, I had a family, a wife and a good job. Every day was a struggle, whether it had been due to an over abundance of bills that were past due, or the stress of working until I was completely exhausted.

## 2020-10-31T12:17:14.901Z - I’ve Been such a Sad Soul, I Know. Every Days Been a Waste, I'm Losing Hope

Every night I'm locked in this room alone Don't know where to go, don't know where to go

The most pathetic state of sadness Lost reality to madness,
I'm as empty as this mattress, just give me some fucking matches,
I'll turn this place into ashes Flip the world up on it's axis,

I see my life as it flashes, how long until this passes
As they place me in the casket, I hope one day you regret
or maybe you'll just forget All the things that I once meant
All the time that we spent All the things I once did
All the bullshit you said All the lies that you hid

Taking my time taking what's mine Rebuilding my life one day at a time
Telling myself I don't need no help Need nobody else to get through this hell
Pick myself up cause I had enough This time I'm done and I'm moving on

It's been so long since I've been me Took so many parts of me
Took off your fucking wedding ring Wouldn't even look at me
6 years that meant nothing But to me meant something
Guess you got what you wanted But for me I'm left haunted

Every days the same Don't want to feel this pain
Something inside me has to change Tired of living this way
I just need to be brave and feel the sun on my face
It's time that I replace Every ounce of hate inside of me

I was meant for so much more I won't live this way no more
I'm taking back what was mine Im finally moving on with my life

Girl you don't know what you have done Cause right now you can't see what you've lost
Just know when you finally hear this song I'll be happy with somebody else where I belong

## 2020-10-31T12:22:49.430Z - I Was Never Meant to Be where I'm at

You weren't supposed to hurt me like that
Too much damage for us to ever go back
I use to be on course but now I'm off track

You left me in the rain on a Saturday
I begged for you to stay but you left anyway
You had nothing left to say all I felt was pain
As your taillights fade away that scene still on replay

And that's how I'll always remember you
As a coward who could never tell the truth

So run away run away
but you can't out run your fate
Cause when it catches up you cannot escape
can't turn back the clocks and go back to yesterday

I hope that you own up
to all that you run from
And admit that you were wrong
For all the shit you've done
All you see is clouds
When you're staring at the sun
You Drink your pain away
Now everything has come undone

## 2020-10-31T12:25:25.170Z - I Don't Understand how You Can Go back and forth between Me and Him. I've Been so Sick to My Stomach. I Am Fucked up over the Whole You and Tyler Thing since Last April

You've seen first hand that my mental state was fucked. I needed your help to watch the girls back in August so I could get help and get better. I wasn't going for the Adderall I was going because of the addiction I have to you and how I can never kick the habit of you. You always run to me when you have a problem cause you have no where else to go and you know that I always wanted you back and you used me to your advantage. Im not mad that you did this shit again. Im mad cause I had a window of opportunity to get better and that window just isn't possible now.
The whole situation is fucked for our kids now and they always get stuck with me when you leave and I can't even take care of myself. You cripple me every time you do this to me and you do it with remorse whatsoever. Night time is the worst. I can't sleep I can't eat and I can't find anything to take mind off of you cause I don't have a single person to talk to. I had to write and get rid of the girls who where there to comfort me while Tyler was comforting you and he was supposed to be as dead as them. How can you be ok with hurting me like this? I just don't know how to recover cause every time I'm close here you come again. You know how much you have hurt me the last year and a half why do you continue to do it? Why do I have to care so much about you. You have fucked up so many things this time around. I chose you over my own son and you let me. i know that, you know that and he knows that. I do want to get better and get on my feet again and not be worthless but you have put me back in this state of mental paralysis.

I was aiming right for you just like a missile
In hopes that you would hear me through the airwaves
And that you'd some how find your way back home to me

I don't know if you're even out there listening
Maybe I'm just not the part of you that's missing
All this time I'm still holding on and wishing
That one day I will wake up to you next to me

Every day has been the same,
I sit at home all alone ain't nothing changed
Waiting for your call but you never call
So I'll just keep broadcasting all these songs

Stevie can you hear me?
As I'm calling out your name?
Turn on your radio to my frequency
So you can hear all I have to say

Stevie are you listening
As I travel through the airwaves
Stevie are you hearing me
Please don't lose your way

I swear that I could write you a song
If i could turn back time just for a moment
Id make every one of them worth it.
Take me back to twenty eleven
And id swear that i was in heaven
if you could have just meant it.
That times not how we Should have spent it.

Life is so complicated
I swear I hate it.
Wish i could face it
but im just waitin
Slowly pacing
Why cant I just erase it

Until we know that everything feels right
its not tonight,
but its alright
Well be just fine
Were still alive

I feel like we're always fighting time
but I wish that I could press rewind
To this place were both trying to find
When I was yours and you were mine

It isn't fair
I should be there
Why do we care
I wanna diassapear

## 2020-10-31T12:45:32.035Z - This is My Chance to Get it Right

For the first time in my life
I can see all the blue skies
I set my aim for my sights

Long days and long nights,
A million ways to fail
But I'mma get it right

Been down, counted out
And I was left for dead but
I Won't feel sorry for myself

Body pains and headaches
Got nothing on heartbreak
Breathe in and breathe out
I use to be so lost
When I was filled with doubt

I took all my sadness and depression
And turned it into vocal expression
Added some eq, waves tune and compression
These were my life's biggest lessons
And my most personal confessions

And I write every night, till I get it right
Won't stop till I see an end in sight
I sing for you to help you get through
And I will be your light when you need me to
I promise I am only here to guide you
I will light up your life till I am right beside you

Keep your Head high, when youre feeing low
And Don't let anyone say you ain't beautiful

When that pain starts to ache
and your heart needs a break
From all the people who are fake
When they lying right to your face
Fuck em all, who cares what they say
Cause you a better person even on your worst days
What you're going through is just a phase
And as time goes by you'll begin to erase and replace
All that shit that's been keeping you in place
Keep One foot forward aim for outerspace
Move as slow as you want just finish the race

I'mma be the light that guides you,
I'll be in that car ridng beside you

Turn up the stereo and get that bass bumping low
And start to show the world that you are beautiful

Every moment feeling blue, my thoughts have me consumed fantasize hanging by a noose
My heart can't take anymore abuse
So sick of feeling used by you

For the sickness you inflicted

You an addict for being dramatic
This time ive had it

Is My Greatest Memory Was that Day We Met at Barnes and Nobles Parking Lot and You Came Walking up in that Yellow Card Shirt with Those Cute Ass Boots On. I Was so Fucking Nervous that I just Looked Stupid Probably

You asked me if you could kiss me and I've been fucked up ever since.

I really hope you know
that I'm trying now
To let it all go right out
To find some peace and move on now
This shit is killing me
It's killing me

I know I've been so hard to be around
You can hear it in my voice as I lose it now
When all I do is scream & shout
Cuz I feel like you can't hear me now

What is love without trust
Without trust there isn't much
What is love without trust
Without trust there isn't much

Do I give up?
Do I say all the things
That made me the person that I never wanted to be?
Do I give a fuck? Yea

I really give a fuck now
Imma get it right
Imma get right with my life this time
Imma get it right
Swear to God I'm going to get it right this time, this time
Imma get right with my life this time
Imma get it right, right, right
And I'll see you in another life
Imma get this right
And I'll see you in another life
Imma get it right

Late nights keep me awake for so long, so long now.
When am I going to ever find myself man?
When am I going to get some help for myself?
I just need to find my way again.

Don't you think it's about time that I just get my life right for once so I can move along?

Tell me now!

I just need to clear my head and need to get my life right again.

I don't know why I'm fuckin Killin time.

## 2020-10-31T19:19:51.000Z - The Day My World Came to an End

"This is the story of Greg Reeves and how he became the Grim Reaper"

Reap told me to turn on the TV
They said it was a tragedy
She was found in the bath
With both of her wrists slashed
She had taken her own life
Just another statistic for suicide
She was only 27 when she died
She was my wife, my whole life
Why, reap why? It wasn't her time!

I'm sorry Greg I know this hurts
This isn't what you deserved
This is a pain that will always hurt
And there's not much for comfort
Fuck a hearse, fuck this curse
put me next to her in the dirt
I don't wanna be alive without her
I'm ready to burn now it's my turn

Please reap take my life
Send me down to hell
So she's not alone at night
I'll be fine it'll be alright

Greg it's not what you think
So wait before you take that drink
Put that gun down and listen to me
She wasn't on the list you see?
which means it's not just a tragedy
It was murder and you need me
To find peace in bringing the end
To everybody who played a part in this

## 2020-10-31T19:20:42.000Z - Shorty

Shorty tryna call
Guess she wanna talk
I'm busy with my homies
We chilled at the mall
So She sends me a pic
With Just her in her bra
And If I come over
Than I can have it all

She says the doors unlocked
My clothes are off
"I'll give you top,
I'll be your thot"
And I won't stop
Till I get you off
I can't get enough
You're my greatest fuck

Aww yeah we gon

Guess you c an fuck off
I'm heading to the club

## 2020-10-31T19:22:02.000Z - Rebirth Remix

So if you leave me babe
I won't die the same
So if you leave me babe
I'll be the one to blame

Verse
I just want my words to matter
To inspire hope and a little laughter
Maybe one day get that happy ever after
For now I’m at the bottom tryna climb the ladder

Been out here on my own
Grinding all alone
Trying to get my shit together
write the perfect flow
I just wanted you to know
That I’m trying to let go
Still trying to find myself
As I’m learning how to grow
And all That pain and sadness
Ain’t ever trying to show
Spent way too many nights
Living like Im on death row
And Now my only goal
turn that sorrow into gold
And Light up the whole room
When I walk in because I glow

I never wanna feel this way again
So low so low so low

Everything good will someday end
Ya know ya know ya know

Verse
Here I go all alone
I’m doing fine all on my own
Don’t need you anymore
just some music and my phone
My hearts grown cold

Cruisin in my fusion
Won’t stop cause I’m not losin
Anymore of myself to anybody else now
Nobody’s gonna let me down again

I won’t lie, or deny
l still think about my wife late at night
and wonder what our life would be like
if she had just fought to try
but it doesn’t even matter
cause the life we had is over
I just hope that she knows
That I always fucking loved her
And no one came before her
Cause I always adored her
but now I must move forward

I was so sad
I was so broken
Wish I could go back

But I was so mad
Over shitty words spoken
Now I leave it in the past

Cause I'm Not taking anymore time
To rewind everything in my life
Cause I’m going in forward motion
Won’t stop till I get where I'm going

## 2020-10-31T19:22:43.000Z - The Letters We'll Never Send

At this point in life I'm a 35 year old single father of 3 beautiful children. Currently trying to rebuild my life after a heartbreaking divorce and a meth addiction. There are so many reasons why I am where I am, some are simply because of misfortune and things out of my control but most were honestly my fault.

At a young age we develop certain senses of wrong and right, good and bad and so on. My life has always been run by emotions, my moods and my choices always stem from whatever emotion I am feeling at those times.

In 2008 I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on Adderall by 2012 I was on the maximum dosage of 60 mg a day. That drug was my lifeline, it made me into a completely different person, it made me dive head first into my passion of creating music and thrive in every work environment I was in. It got me promoted to jobs I never would have been interested in before, I was making money I had never been able to make previously, but it came with a price. The biggest price of them all. It cost me my wife, my children and my friend's. I put all my time and effort into things that really didn't matter at the end of the day, all my attention went to myself and how long can you neglect the people that love and care about you before they give up on you? 6 years was my answer to that. 6 years of neglect to my then wife and to my son and my daughter's, to my friends and family members. I was a recluse. A machine, a robot working only for myself and when everything finally came crashing down, the last person I wnted to blame was myself. I wanted to be angry at everyone else but myself, I wanted crucify those closest, mostly my ex wife. I know she tried to get me to see where I was going wrong and what I was doing wrong. How I was lacking in being a boyfriend, than in being a husband and finally in being a father.

I care so deeply about people yet I lack so much in showing it.

## 2020-10-31T19:29:37.000Z - REPAER

I don't remember who I was back then
Before the darkness came and never left
Cause who I am now is worse than death
I am the cold air that shivers from your breath
The reason your eyes glow red
When you're angry and upset up
I won't let you forget
I am your biggest regrets
I am your silhouette
When the darkness
comes to collect
On all your unpaid debt
I am the reaper
you just don't know it yet

And somewhere along the way
I lost myself to all the hate
And all the pain
I turned it all into
Everything I became

## 2020-10-31T19:30:04.000Z - My Fate

I see it every day
Every day
that look on your face
Telling me I'm just a waste
But I can't escape this place

I Can't out run my fate
I know my heart broke
In so many ways
I Can't out run my fate
I know my heart broke
In so many ways

No hope I'm a lost cause
No joke all I gots flaws
Going through withdrawal
Demons start to crawl
Now I'm getting lost
Tell me what's it cost

What's it cost?
Why'd you leave?
I don't wanna go
But I'm gone
I'm done
playing games
I'm gone
no more pain

No more pain
All you brought me was the hurt
And every word you said a lie
It's all a lie

## 2020-10-31T19:30:51.000Z - Decrescendo

Endings are hard, life changing, sometimes life ending, I think it's safe to say I'll never be the same person I was before 2017. Dreams were shattered, love was broken, hope was lost. That fear of monsters being real as a child came to life only those monsters never came from under the bed or out of the closet, they disguised themselves in human form. They became the reason I never slept, they got in my head and made me question my self worth, they made me believe I would never be anything and I'd never be happy again. They made me question my own life every day until I started becoming one of them myself. My whole life I lived by a set of standards and morals so that I would never cross over to the dark side. I had boundaries, lines that I would never cross to keep me safe from being the next Anakin Skywalker and now I understand exactly why he became Darth Vader because when people you love fuck you up and show you a side of themselves and life that you never thought were real, it creates a catastrophic chain of events inside your belief system and in the foundation you've built your life upon. Love turned into pain, pain turned into hate and hate turned into feeling nothing. What I've learned is that Hate is not the greatest negative emotion, feeling nothing is, because if you hate something it's for a reason, a purpose, but to feel nothing and do things that hurt people for no reason, for no purpose, you can really fuck the world up and far too many of us feel nothing anymore. For a long time I balanced myself on all the lines that I swore I would never cross and than one by one I didn't care anymore and after every line I crossed that structure and foundation of who I once was started caving in. Wall after wall, floor after floor until it buried me underneath it and it wasn't until the basement collapsed that I realized there is no rock bottom, there's no bottom at all to the holes we dig for ourselves, it's never ending and you can just keep going until the consequences of your actions and choices catch up to you and either kill you or mentally impair you

## 2020-10-31T19:31:12.000Z - Passenger

One thing I've come to realize the most is that our inner demons aren't there to hurt us, they're there to hurt all the people that love us, they take them out one by one until it's just you and them and then they become you. I see it all around me, even in myself. So much darkness, so much anger, so much misunderstanding and all that does is bring those demons to life. They are awaken from hibernation by your surroundings, by the trauma, the environment, anxiety, bad relationships, anything that is negative. You don't have to come from a broken home, you don't have to be abused as a child, they don't just come out because of your childhood, I think that a lot of them probably stem from your childhood but they thrive more in your adulthood because you no longer have that innocence you had as a child to protect you. We are all born with the sense of wrong and right and the ability to be good or bad. It all comes down to a choice, a line drawn between the light and the darkness and once you cross that line you better distance your self from everyone who cares about you because you've just become a ticking time bomb to all of them, but of course it's too late for that cause that good part of you is now permanently in the passenger seat while your demons come to life.

## 2020-10-31T19:31:51.000Z - Don't Let the Darkness Take You

I'm sorry that
I couldn't save you
I tried my best
but my light won't reach you
I would have stayed
And been lost with you
But you locked me out
And let the darkness take you

I Guess it's time to finally admit it's the end
Cause there is no chance for us to ever be again
Too much damage done that you could never mend
And when it comes to you I break instead of bend

You can tell the world how it was all my fault
You can blame me for the death of Jensen blame me for it all
Its just so you feel better and I take the fall
I'll be the villain in our story when you talk

I'm sorry that
I couldn't save you
I tried my best
but my light won't reach you
I would have stayed
And been lost with you
But you locked me out
And let the darkness take you

## 2020-10-31T19:59:10.000Z - Premeditated

Got some shit I want to say
Not sure where I should start at
I will accept all of the blame
Never meant to leave you broken hearted
I wish that we could change
and just go back to when we first started
I hope some day that you'll be ok
When you learn that I have departed

There were lines that got crossed
And shit just got out of hand
So much that we all lost
Things nobody understands

Thought I had it figured out
But found myself in some doubts
There's no going back now
Everything is upside down
I will not be found, no, no, no
I will not be around, no, no, no

There's no going back this time
I think I finally lost my mind
Just want to leave it all behind
And I'll see you in another life

Straight out the fucking grave I came
I told your ass that I'd be back again for you
someday
And Now their ain't a good damn thing that you can ever say or ever change
Cause the king of death came all this fucking way
Just to make sure your end is filled with pain

And what a shame
you cannot die every day
You are such a waste
your mom made a mistake
yea You nothing but a fuckin fake
Who will be erased without a trace
Now take my place in that grave
And what a shame
you cannot die every day
You are such a waste
your mom made a mistake
yea You nothing but a fuckin fake
Who will be erased without a trace
Now take my place in that grave

I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at and
I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at

I just don't get it
so pathetic
Wont forget it
won't regret it
It's poetic
Fuckin epic
I will not be
Sympathetic
And No need for a medic
Cause It's a fetish
That Got me feeling energetic
Like I'm full of meth and
you guessed it
Im obsessed
With your death
You don't get it
And I won't stop
Until I get it

You can run but you can't hide
Promise you that I will catch up in time
You can run and you can hide
Promise you that I will catch up

It's a death trap
everywhere that I'm at
Everywhere you go
you know that I will follow

You can run but you can't hide
I'm a catch up and it's gon be the end of you
End of you

I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at and
I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at

Cuz I'm not dead
But you're dead
Ill do anything to
get you out my head

I'm a cut you head to toe
And send your soul
straight down to hell

Acting like I'm somebody you want and
But you were never good at being honest

Cause I'm always second best
Now all I do is second guess

These days I been growin heartless
Wont fuck with you no I'm not retarded
Cause I know exactly where your heart is
With that other bitch there's no restartin

Tore my heart out my chest

Sad to say that we were never meant
So I guess that it's best I just forget

Dead and gone

## 2020-10-31T20:05:04.000Z - Return to Sender

Yeah it's hard to wake
Hard to face
All of my past mistakes
all this weight
From yesterday
I can no longer carry
My heart you buried.
Grave stone found in the cemetery
So hateful
Gotta stay low
Wit a plate full
You ungrateful
You the Same hoe
Friend now a foe
Hard to let go
Some shits just hard to swallow
But I will not follow
You down to the hollows
Cause your soul it swallows
And I just want to get out
So sick of all the bullshit
I think I found my way out
I Left you in your bullshit
And I don't want you to drown
But you chose this for yourself now

Shot through the heart
Stabbed in the back
Don't care where you are

Ungrateful
Platef

And all the shit you say
You murdered me

## 2020-10-31T20:06:27.000Z - Becoming A Ghost

Why am I so sad
Always so mad
I don't miss love
But I really miss the drugs

Cause at least I felt somethin
Now all I feel is nothing
Now my ghost haunting
Put me in a coffin
I don't give a fuck and
I'm a die alone
So bitter and cold
Guess Better on my own

Close the door and go
Leave me all alone
Stab me in the back
Never come back home

You rich and now I'm broke
You tuned me to a joke
On my words now imma choke
I wish we never spoke

I hope you're happy
Cause right now I'm just done
Actin so fuckin tough and
Just wanna say fuck it
I don't wanna do this anymore

## 2020-10-31T20:07:28.000Z - No Redemption

Words left unsaid
Guess we're dead
You siad it's for the best
And you wish we never meant
Now I just wanna forget

Lately I've been wandering
Aimlessly around on my own
It's dark and cold
Nobody's home
Hate being alone
There's no where to go
Nobody calling on my phone
Loneliness cuts right through me to the bone

Hello God are you there
Do you even still care
I know this shit ain't fair
I only pray when no one's here
I know it's not your fault
I never listen when you talk
I only miss things when they're gone
I know now that I'm wrong

Please guide me in the right direction
I swear this will be my last confession
Please save me from my depression
Cause right now all I want is to end itl

## 2020-10-31T20:08:31.000Z - Used To Being Used

Damn you got me feeling low
Knife in the back what a blow
Now my heart growin cold
All that love done turned to stone

I used to be gold
I used to have goals
I used to have hope
Now you think I'm a joke

All this pain inside my brain
Has got me so fucked up
Replacing love with all the drugs
Seems it's not enough
Is fucking me up I'm not okay

I used to have a home

So full of hope

an old soul
Searching for somebody to hold
And build a home

## 2020-10-31T20:09:00.000Z - Stimulant

10 years on a stimulant
Once felt like my favorite drug
Now I feel insignificant
60 mg just isn't enough

times are tough
life is rough
been losing love

been losing trust
Don't give a fuck

Since they cut me off
Might as well have
pulled the plug
Might as well
have put a gun
Up to my dome
And shot it off

Sick of not feeling that rush
I'm an addict for that crack shit

feel like I'm always stuck
my demons tell me to give up

## 2020-10-31T20:09:42.000Z - Kcuf

Fuck these feelings
I'm way past grieving
Your lies deceiving
My head still high
Way up towards the ceiling

Fuck your sorrys

Maybe that one time
Oh wait yea right hardly

Go shake them hips
Around someone elses dick
You make me sick
On that sinkin ship
Get a grip on
And go fuck yourself you stupid bitch

## 2020-10-31T20:10:57.000Z - Alive In December

Oh she hit me with a text
Always bullshit with this ex
Call me up just for sex
One more reason to regret
I wish we never met
When all I want is to forget

You left me dead back in November
Hole in my chest don't you remember
I tried to put myself back together
It's been 3 years and I'm alive in December

## 2020-10-31T20:11:39.000Z - Holly Jolly Christmas

Two years ago I asked santa to hit you with his sleigh
and this year please know That still hasn't changed
cause youre still as cold as the ice on the troughs
You're so cold you turned your own heart into frost

I'm trying to be on my best behavior
But you got me feeling like a hater

I woke up to the snow falling on the rooftop
Another year has passed and I know it won't stop
I tried to change, tried to behave,
tried to escape but it's all the same

This year for Christmas
All I want is to be Jolly
So if you're into buying
Please just get me some Molly

Two years ago
I was alone

Next it'll be your soul
Don't mean to gloat
But I am now the goat

Merry Christmas to you that's

Get Rudolph high as hell

## 2020-10-31T20:13:35.000Z - Trash

Back in the day
Had so much to say
To that beautiful face
It was a steady pace
It Wasn't a race
there wasn't a chase
No worries about anyone
takin my place
times they have changed
Now I'm a disgrace
Somebody that you now
try and erase
But you can't escape
How you became fake
Chose him over me
Now I am replaced
By someone who wont
love you the same
That's what you get
I was never to blame
Your love was a game
I never wanted to play
Cause I got played
And that's not okay
fuck what you say
Your words full of hate
Now it's too late
You chose your fate
I hope that you stay
Forever away.
That would be great
I'll say it again
Stay the fuck away
Your words breed hate

## 2020-10-31T20:14:26.000Z - Enough

Cause the world is so loud

## 2020-10-31T20:14:57.000Z - Not Your Fault

I just wanted you to know
it's not your fault
Just put me in the ground
watch me dissolve
It's all my fault
All my fault
I'm sorry that I'm filled
With all these flaws

## 2020-10-31T20:15:49.000Z - OMG

Oh my God
What the fuck have I done
What the fuck have I become
What the fuck do I do now
That I am the devil's son
I can feel that demon blood
Moving through my body
like a motha fuckin flood
Fuck I don't give a fuck
But I want to give a fuck
Cause now I've become
Someone that nobody can trust
So I should just give up
Cause I'm a piece of shit
I am my donors son

## 2020-10-31T20:16:30.000Z - Let Me Go

Let me go
I know you don't love me
Anymore
I know You just used me
So let me go
Cause you're not the same
As before

Broke my heart than tore it apart
Kicked me when I was down
Left me for dead on the ground

## 2020-10-31T20:18:12.000Z - On Repeat

I thought the point here was to be honest
So all I do is try and open up and stay modest
But I know it's too late doesn't even matter
What I say or how I change you'll always be stuck in your ways
I'm tired of going nowhere when my aim is set for you
All this back and forth shit really got me coming unglued

## 2020-10-31T20:18:51.000Z - Abandoned

Dear God,
I think i've had enough
this planet is doomed
and I'm giving up
I'm sorry but there's
no one that I can trust
and lately I find myself not caring
and not giving a fuck

Maybe it's just me
and I've gone crazy
My thoughts get loud
I scream and I shout
But you don't ever hear me now

Maybe I'm just changing
into somebody
That I'm already hating
my life is yours for the taking
Oh please God
I'm tired of waiting

I pray that you'll save me
I pray that you hear me
I pray till I fall asleep
why aren't you listening?
I pray that you'll save me
I pray that you hear me
I pray till I fall asleep
why aren't you listening?

I guess maybe it's true
what they say
That you lost hope
And walked away

I guess maybe
there is no hope
and there's only one
other thing I know
that can take me
where I want to go
walking through the shadows
at night all alone

Hey REAP
can you hear me?
I can't sleep
I'm in too deep
and I think
maybe if I sink
I can bring you
here with me
Hey REAP
can you hear me?
I can't sleep
I'm in too deep
and I think
maybe if I sink
I can bring you
here with me

See you soon

## 2020-10-31T20:19:17.000Z - IM SORRY FOR WHO I AM

Somewhere between sad and stressed
There's a chapter where you'll find me at my best
Where we were happy like when we first met
And I wish that story would never end

But sadly yeah you, you left me
I always ruin everything
Please forgive me
Cause I'm sorry
That who I am
Is not who you thought

Who I am right now
Will only bring you down
I am the darkness
In everything Im around

## 2020-10-31T20:19:39.000Z - No Vacancy

Mother I hope you know that
I'm sorry for everything
I hope you know it's not your fault
That I'm in this grave

Don't know where to go now
Don't know what to say now
I'm Better off dead I know now

Words can't explain
The pain in my brain
And I can't escape
This was always my fate

## 2020-10-31T20:20:02.000Z - ---

Fuck being down
Fuck counted out
Watch me turn it around
Watch me running this town

Looks like the devil on my shoulder
Has got the angel bent the fuck over

Fuck depression, fuck lack of attention or lack of affection

This goes out to all the fucking haters
All the bullies, all the liars and all the players

This goes out to all the kids who got nothing
But still get out of bed every day to be something

God damn it I fuckin it had it
with all these lame ass fucking faggots
Go grab me the automatic
Don't give a fuck if I'm bein dramatic
cause I've had it This shit will be over traumatic

Listen you don't know me

so you can blow me
or you gonna get a nose bleed
end up dying slowly
Cause I fucked your skully
Now it's awfully holy
Told you you don't know me

That bitch was a whore
That goes against everything I stand for

Fuck all the shitty peeps,
Fuck the petty thieves
Fuck anyone that
has ever lied to me
Fuck everyone who

like the one who fucked my girl I'm bringing you to the end of the world

## 2020-10-31T20:20:47.000Z - Molly

I'm so full of myself
Bitches wishing me well
They under my spell
Met this thot outside some hotel
Her moans sound like they yells
Called her Molly but her name's Michelle
Sorry but it's not like I care to know you
You just a hoe and I see right through you
Guess I'm going to hell
Probably burn in a cell
Don't need any help
Cause I'm doin well
All i do is Excel
Always ringing the bell

Gonna burn in a cell
Fuck it not gonna dwell
Called her Marie
guess her name is Michelle

That shit
I need some help
I can already tell
I'm going to hell
No need to dwell

## 2020-10-31T20:21:39.000Z - Progress

I started to write you a book but I don't need to anymore for the first time in eight years you and I are on the same exact page and I couldn't be any more fucking proud of you for finally coming forward and telling me the truth so that I could be free of this hell we have been in. I never would have chased you had I known you truly didn't want me but we are good. As for Tyler I don't ever have to forgive him and he will always be something that I will not say in this message because I know it's disrespectful towards you but I am never going to cause drama between you two I will let you to be as happy or as miserable as you guys want to be and by the end of this weekend I am cutting ties with all of your family and not like on a some fuck shit but to remind them that you are their family and their sister it doesn't matter what you choose or who you choose to be with they need to support you and only you and that there's no hard feelings on anybody's side. I'm not going to give you a single reason to ever come at me as a reason why shit didn't work out this time around. I got nothing but love for your family. And nothing but respect for you finally owning your shit. I have no regrets Stevie, I made mistakes, and I became a better person but the fact that you didn't want me and pretended that was brought the worst out of me. I hope you never ever put anybody through that ever again because had this gone any further in a negative direction I have no doubt in my mind I would have killed all of us just to be free of this curse. Thank you for setting me free I mean that shit you will not hear from me again

## 2020-10-31T20:21:58.000Z - THE TAKEOVER

## 2020-10-31T20:22:37.000Z - **

put down your picture
And I grabbed a notebook and pen
Replayed the night we met
I won't forget but this is about the end
We tried, we lied, we'd fight, wed hide
We'd cry, we died inside and
Each time we'd find hate in our eyes
From pride who's wrong who's right and
We grew apart
threw sharpened darts
aimed at the heart
spiteful remarks
nights at the bar
I crashed the car
It got too hard
No chance
to restart

Bu I won't let you go
without holding you close
Just to let you know
you always mattered most

I will light the way
I will illuminate
And erase all the hate
To much brighter days
I hope you are ok
Learn from your pain
And Find ways to change
Don't stay in one place
Or it all stays the same

## 2020-10-31T20:23:07.000Z - ENDER

I swear to God my life been on repeat
Every day the same all I feel is defeat
Feels like my feet are planted in the concrete
Only thing that ever changes is my heart beat
Depression got me low like a down beat

I need a retreat
I need a cheat sheet
Go back and delete
Hours on my time sheet
So I can resync
Going hard like a drum beat

I cant think I can't breathe
Anxiety, tryna fucking kill me
Maybe death is better than being a deadbeat
They got me in the back like a car seat
Nobody sees me
I'll be obsolete
Left for dead on the side street

With a sign that says free
Please take me
A home is all that I need
And maybe then I won't be
So lonely so emprty
Reset me forget me
Don't miss me I'm nothing

But a sad soul
That turned into a ghost
That got lost long ago
I’ll stay unknown I just know
As my heartbeat it turns cold
I shiver down to the bones

All that I know
Is I can't let go
Of what mattered most
I'm losing control
And I Was told
This is death row
And I'm gonna die alone

## 2020-10-31T20:23:24.000Z - Deaths Anthem

I'm growing colder with each and every day

Now look out
as they scream and shout
Morbid sounds
coming from the underground
where I am found
I was hell bound
Tried to be held down
by the devil's dog pound
Be he soon found
I made em into hell hounds
And made the earth my playground
Can you hear me now
as I call out
I am the cloud
that causes you to drown
In your self doubt
Turn you gangstas into clowns
in your own town
Better fucking watch your mouth
Before I fucking rip that tongue right out

Ay yo reap
Take a seat
And slow the fuck down
You can't just take the hearse
And make the Earth your playground
We had a deal so don't disregard it now
It's still my body
Not your body
So Stop being so cocky
Dont make me karate
Your ass outta me
Like a sodomy
Fucked up lobotomy

Fuck your policy

I'll be the star
You can call me astronomy
If this is your standard policy

I question every day
If I made a mistake
Maybe there's a better way
I dunno, Guess it's all the same
Cause I chose this fate
And we both know that itsToo late
for change

Im consumed by hate
im irate and fill up with rage
When I see your face
I increase in heart rate
I drown in heart ache
And you're to blame
For every fucking thang
You fuckin fake
Our paths will me again some day
And I'll put your ass in place
It's a date
Checkmate

## 2020-10-31T20:23:43.000Z - Don't Bother

You left without a word
I wonder where you went
You know I don't deserve
To always feel like shit
So why do you do this
I'll never understand

Guess it's just out of my hands
I know you know I've been through hell and back you know it's true so why do you still continue to hurt me

Fuck it I guess
Fuck it im dead
Fuck what you said
Fuck the time spent
Fuck all the mess that you left
Fuck your regrets
Fuck all the things that I want to forget
Fuck it you're deaf
Fuck you for making me feel I was less
Fuck all the stress
Fuck you I wish that we had never met
Fuck I'm depressed
Fuck you for ripping this heart out my chest

## 2020-10-31T20:24:12.000Z - After Dark II

I just wanna be somebody you can see

Everything has taken all of this from me

But I've been looking up when everything is down

And I'm trying to pick myself back off the ground

And all I've done is fucking is die

Every fucking time you do this shit

I wanna die

But I can't help who you are

and I know it cant be the same

So we let it go with the words you say

I'm telling you that everyday

Everything you ever said

Has always meant something

More to me than you will see

And I just wish that I could have shown you

The way, the way it should be

The way it could be

The way you fucking do this shit

its not ok but I dont take it back

And I'm so fucking lost

## 2020-10-31T20:24:35.000Z - PUDDLE OF BLOOD

Where the fuck you think you at?
Bitches better get back

Listen,

Rollin through the creek
Given you the creeps
While we watch you sleep
Death is all we wreap

Better own your shit right now bitch
Better own your shit right now now now

Mother fuckers act
Like we ain't packing gats

## 2020-10-31T20:24:57.000Z - THAT SADBOY FLEX

Another day I'm trapped inside
This hell of mine I made in my mind
Now that your gone I feel so numb
Don't give a fuck cause I'm not enough
What the fuck am I doing here
All I see is darkness everywhere
Tell me where to go
When I don't have a home
And Im feeling so alone
nobody even knows
But that's how the story goes
I lost what mattered most
Tie this noose around my throat
I think it's time that I let go
Another day I'm trapped inside
This hell of mine I made in my mind
Now that your gone I feel so numb
Don't give a fuck cause I'm not enough
What the fuck am I doing here
All I see is darkness everywhere
Tell me where to go
When I don't have a home
And Im feeling so alone
nobody even knows
But that's how the story goes
I lost what mattered most
Tie this noose around my throat
I think it's time that I let go

## 2020-10-31T20:25:13.000Z - Stop

Changin up
Feeling stuck
Not enough
I never was
So fill my cup
With empty love
Don't give a fuck
Cause I'm done

stop what you're doing
and listen to me for once please reap
We can't keep doing this to everybody
Just stop what you're doing
And get the fuck out of my body
For once please reap
We can't keep doing this to everybody
Just stop what you're doing
And get the fuck out of my body

## 2020-10-31T20:25:33.000Z - Seven

It's been 7 years to the day
When your mom she called me
To tell me your heart stopped beating
I felt my chest sink to my gut
And in that moment the whole world stopped
And I ran out the door before that phone could hit the floor,

I thought if I kept running, running, running
I could build enough momentum,
to travel back in time and rewrite your life
just like the flash and I will bring you back
and when I arrived I saw your mother's eyes and I knew that it was too late

And that I failed you I'm sorry
Told your mom not to worry
That he would be alright
And everything will turn out fine
I guess I'm a liar now
As we buried you in the ground
In that tiny little casket
Where the fucks our God now

I thought that after you were gone,
Me and your mom we'd hold on and stay strong you were what made us strong you were are closest bond but I was wrong cause see your mom she blames me, she breaks my fucking heart every time she puts that on me
And says it was my fault cause I made her leave for three days cause all she did was yell at me and it was all misunderstanding and I called my best friend cause I just needed some perspective and now she blames her too like it was me just a game to me and you, I'm sorry I dragged you in this Kristin,
cause I kicked her out for three days when she was being

pulled us together but it just toreus apart when she thought of you
We spent the next 5 years recovering, I think your mom still blames me, says that my mistakes caused you to feel pain and I think maybe you tried to escape cause you already knew our fate

And I ran faster than I ever ran cause maybe if I ran fast enough I could go through time and bring him back again
I kept

The world stopped turning
Confusion burning I was

## 2020-10-31T20:26:03.000Z - RIDING SHOTGUN

I just wanted to say that I am sorry
For all the times I hurt you
I hope you know I never meant to
No, no
I got this darkness trapped inside of me
And I thought that I was in control
till I realized I was in the passenger seat
And the reaper was running the show

Oh no I'm not in control
Of my mind and body anymore
Oh no here we fucking go though
As the reaper makes his way into my soul

## 2020-10-31T20:26:15.000Z - BITCH QUIT PLAYIN

Bitch I own you
I Thought I fucking told you
There ain't no where to go
So you better just stay home

Fuck all these games that you plays
Stop running away every day
Told you there is no escape
This is your fate

And We'll be one of the greats ok?
The greatest reapers that were ever made
We fill these humans souls with hate
And we reap the benefits every day

I'm tired of you fightin me this is your destiny
You're the one who called upon me mother fucker
There is no escape

## 2020-10-31T20:26:31.000Z - Kill Me With Silence

I wonder how many times
You can hurt someone you love
before they take their own life
Because they felt not enough

Don't stop drinking
just cause I need you here with me
Don't start worrying
As I bleed out in the bathtub please

I'm sorry love but you fucking kill me
Every time you chose to ignore me

Tell me why I'm not enough
when I just wanted you to
give a fuck

## 2020-10-31T20:26:48.000Z - Forget it

I wish that I could say that it was worth the wait
But you left me second guessing every day
I wish that I could say that it was worth the pain
But you hurt me in ways to where I'll never be the same

Again look what you did to me no no not same again you told me nothing again look what you did to me now. Same again you took my chest

But the truth is I'm just not the same
I was hurt in ways that made me change

## 2020-10-31T20:27:23.000Z - Siren Call

What is my purpose
cause I been feeling so worthless
I'm so tired of being hurt and
I'm just ready to be free of this curse

Maybe one day
I will find a way to be ok
and shit will finally change
instead of being the same

So lead me out in the rain
And watch me drown like it's all the same
Yea yea

Cause I can't get away
from all this shit up in brain
And I'm tired of the chase
when all it does is bring me pain

Let it go
Learn to control
What hurts the most
Time it moves slow
Don't lose your hope
Build a new home
Somewhere you can grow
Love and let go
Don't give up now
I'll guide you out

I know I'm not worthless
Now that I have found my purpose
I finally opened up the curtains
And I'm no longer hurtin

So lead me out of the dark
And try and restart that light in my heart
Yea yea

## 2020-10-31T20:28:17.000Z - Question Mark

Listen, it's not very often I ask anyone to take a few seconds and just listen to what I have to say, (cause in retrospect, I am pretty insignificant,) but every so often I unlock what I like to call life achievements

You're going to get hurt many times throughout your life, sometimes for unexplained reasons, sometimes because certain people enjoy seeing you hurt, but whatever the reason is or may be, we all do the same thing from a very young age.

We build a defense system and put up walls to prevent others from hurting us anymore than we've already been hurt. (Is everyone still following and on the same page with me here?)

Now this is where most of us fuck up, not because we put up giant walls and keep upgrading the security system. (I agree that to an extent we all need this system in place to protect us.)

Here's the issue, how many people out there know what a firewall is and how to actually use it?

A firewall is exactly the type of defense system we install in ourselves, it's there to protect us from incoming threats and to regulate us from sending too much of ourselves to the wrong people. I have found that the majority of us tend to stick to the default setting though and all of you default settings peeps out there is what's fucking everyone's love life up

## 2020-10-31T20:28:58.000Z - Damn

You just don't get it and that's ok, I have finally come to terms that we are two different people and that we do not have, nor share the same interests in life anymore. You have left me to struggle in all of my worst moments and chose a toxic environment that was far worse than ours ever was over me Every time. I'm sorry but there is no excuse, the kids would have had a roof over their heads, if you would have just stuck it out at my mom's the first 4 times we could have saved up and moved again but you ran like you always do and I'm tired of chasing after you begging you to love me when you don't even know what love is. I think Tyler's version of love is something you relate to more than my version. I'm not trying to put you down and be mean but I am fucking angry and I deserve to be angry at you. I should have moved on after the apartment, you could never do shit the right way and you still can't. I'm tired of being the only one who wants to change and see things in a different perspective. You have always stayed true to you and your own beliefs even when those beliefs had faults. I gave up everything I stood for that you did not like just cause I loved you and felt like we had to compromise and change things for each other but you never changed, you stayed the same and put all the blame on me until I felt so worthless I wanted to die and then you found Tyler and you fucking killed me Stevie. The worst part is you still don't give a fuck about me and you don't have the fucking balls to say it which says a lot about who you are. I realized that I am so insignificant to you that you can't take 2 seconds out of your busy day to just say hi without me having to do it first. I also realized there are people out there who want to drop everything they're doing just to talk to me and wanna know how my day is. Regardless of how stressful or shitty their situation is and what's going on in their lives, ya know believe it or not some people have it way worse than you and me and they still wanna try and give me their time while I'm out here trying to give you mine and you don't want it??? Come on I have come to accept that we will never be the same again. You hurt me in ways I would never hurt you and you made me feel so small and worthless every time you did it. I can't let that shit go anymore, I can't pretend or act like I don't care that you don't care about me anymore. I'm good being alone, it's better than being used and being lied to. All I wanted was the truth and I'll never get it from you anymore. I'm not sure you even remember what being honest is like. I will always love you and I will always be angry at you for giving up on me and choosing that piece of shit over me 9 times. 9 fucking times that's not an accident or a mistake it's a choice. I hope you still find peace and happiness and I don't really care if you don't want the same for me, cause you obviously never wanted me to be happy in the first place.

Wake up you're just sleeping, oh no
Wake up you're just dreaming, oh no
Wake up you're just sleeping, oh no
Wake up you're just dreaming, oh no
I think I broke
something bad in my head
Cause nothing here

They call me death
like I'm some kind of plague
Wake up you're just sleeping, oh no
Wake up you're just dreaming, oh no
Wake up you're just sleeping, oh no
Wake up you're just dreaming, oh no

Full of regret
Must be Im dead

## 2020-10-31T20:31:50.000Z - Failed To Mention

Guess I failed to mention
Been suffering from all the depression
turning pain into obsession
But that shit was never my intention
Intention, I need an intervention
Cause I ain't getting live or affection
Keep me guessin, I'm 2nd best and
Maybe I'm crying out for attention
I need to learn to accept
That this time it is the end
And I can't go back again
that will be my cause of death
Where's all the time at
That I gave to you?
Where's all the lo

I Guess it's time to mention
Been taking drugs to help with my depression
Building up so much tension
That now i got something to confess and
Regret and I wish we never met and
Made that deal for you to connect and
Inject yourself without my consent and
Now you reap the benefits by causing death man

Now you made you ascension

I go hard like an erection
That made a mess
Anxiety fucks me when I'm stressin
Lately I got so much aggression
There's a darkness progressin

## 2020-10-31T20:35:06.000Z - No Exit

The walls are closing in
and I feel like I'm gonna break
My light is growing dim
And I don't know how much I can take

Now my mind begins to replay
every scene I hate,
And I feel so trapped inside this place
But I just can't escape

Can anybody hear me
As I'm crying out for help
I can't find the way out
There's no exit in hell

Why why why

## 2020-10-31T20:35:38.000Z - You're The Best

It's been 2 years now that I'm still at my mom's
I hope she's knows I'm so thankful for all that she's done
Not just for me but for my children too
Cause we all been through the ringer, including you (and you have too)

I know I've been a wreck,
I been a mess
and that I cannot handle my stress
but I Promise I am tryin my best
to start being myself again

But I'm not sure who the hell I am
I gave everything to those who don't give a damn
I don't need a hand, I need a plan
I need you to understand
Right now I am a broken man
I'm doing all that I can
To put this into action
With a lighter and a gas can
I'll light
While I hit the gas and
And get some cash for
The bitch who is too bad

## 2020-10-31T20:36:12.000Z - 2nd Sucks

Tell me that I was right
Tell me it was all a lie
Tell me I ain't worth your time
Tell me it's goodbye

Tell me you don't care
Tell me life ain't fair
Tell me all about your affair
Tell me Ill never compare

Tell me that I'm second best
So I don't have to 2nd guess
whether or not I'm just a regret
That you spend trying to forget
And I can put that doubt to rest
Tear my heart out of my chest
Leave my whole life in a mess

Oh God, where did I go wrong?

## 2020-10-31T20:36:42.000Z - Broken Family

I never wanted us to be a broken family
I never wanted you to be my use to be
You were my everything now you're a memory
The one who got the best of me while other now get less from me

I struggle every day to try and let you go
You were the drug I would always overdose

Let me go time on hold
you don't know
And it shows

## 2020-10-31T20:37:17.000Z - Revision II

I wrote a hundred songs in the last 3 months
Most of them were shit but I don't give a fuck
cause to me they were just enough
for the nights I couldn't overcome.

It was my way to cope when I had no hope, thought a lot about that rope
and that ain't no joke,
most of my words went unheard
cause I choked,
this ain't the life I chose.
I just wanted you to know
that ever since you left,
time it moves slow.
While I'm out here trying to grow
but get caught in the undertow,
I don't want to let you go
and you need to know....

That deep down I'm still hurtin,
some days my life seems uncertain
while I hide behind these fucking curtains,
we been steady flirtin
but lately I feel I'm a burden,
so fucked up I'm swervin,
I see the curves but don't know if I'm turnin.

God damn, I miss you every day,
that beautiful face and our home that's now a vacant place.
I wish I could erase both of our mistakes,
I wish that we had changed our ways
but most of all I wish you had stayed
cause I needed you when I lost my way
and every now and then I go back to that day and I hate everything.

I'm sorry that I gave up on myself,
I'm sorry I put that weight on you and made life hell.
I'm sorry for all the times I got consumed by my music,
I'm sorry I couldn't help you get through your own shit.

I'm sorry that I let you down
and that you felt you needed somebody else cause I wouldn't listen or give you more affection,
when I should have been given more than you were gettin,
Cause all you ever wanted was my attention.

All that weight, all that pain, all the blame,
it's not all on you,
I own my faults cause I fucked up too.
I still love you, I still want you,
I wonder how you're doing
Cause I still miss you.

One day I hope that we can start fresh
And move past all of that mess
And finally find a way to forgive and forget
I will admit, I have to still grow up a bit
And find a way to change my shit
Cause even I'm gettin sick of it
Always throwin a fit about how life's a bitch.
Be a better man and make better plans so we can actually start to fix this.

I miss your kiss and your eyes
when they light up like the sunshine,
I miss you all the time. I miss you being mine and that smile when everything feels right and our souls come together and we take flight into the night until the sun rise,
baby we gon be alright, it just takes time.
Need to heal our minds and change our lives

And get to know each other all over again, cause we not the same people we were when we met.

I want to know everything about you
So this time I know the best way to love you
And I will never judge you
or use your faults against you,
this time I only want to help you.

Tear down those walls
and build trust so that if you ever fall,
you won't even worry at all
cause I'll be there to catch you
And make sure when you land you stand tall.

Our last chapter ended in tragedy
Cause we never took "how to love" at the academy
and I don't ever want you to be mad at me,
I just want you to be proud of me and for us to always live happily.

Ever after, it ain't now or never. it's forever.

Till death do us part, through sickness and health,
we'll never be poor cause we'll be each other's wealth
You're my better half who showed me heaven when I was destined for hell.
and I promise this time when we die, our story they will tell.

A real life fairy tale that ended well.

## 2020-10-31T20:37:31.000Z - Moments of Impact

I wonder how
you're doing now
Are you happy
And better off now
Or do you still think about
The times we had
and get filled with doubt?

I can't change you
I don't want to
I can't hate you
Cause all I do is love you
I can't change you
I don't want to
I can't hate you
Cause all I do is love you

Oh I remember
when you smiled At me
for the first time.
I knew you were my everything
Since that November
When we first kissed I
knew you were the one thing
I would always cherish
I'd always want to marry

## 2020-10-31T20:39:29.000Z - I Won't Let You Fail

Life is what you make it
don't live your life in a casket
Just a little longer now
I promise I'll guide you out

Been a long time since I've been happy
But I know most of that was all my fault
Didn't see the right way to live
cuz I was living my own way
I promised that I would take all that pain and put it on to everyone that ever hurt me

Yeah I swear to you that's the only way
The only way to fail now
Cuz I was wrong in every way
Nothing gets solved by negativity

Promise I'll guide you
just grab my hand we'll go together
Make it out of all these embers in December promise you, you'll remember
All the things that I tell you
cuz imma do it right
The right way the only way I know now
And I ain't never going to let you down now

I love you.
no matter where you are
no matter what you do
no matter what you've done
stay true to you

Cuz I won't let you fail
No I wont let you fail
Cuz you're too good
to fall to the dark ever again

I'll hold the light
I'll make it right
please take my hand
together we'll leave this place

## 2020-10-31T20:40:49.000Z - REAPING SEASON

I feel the anger start to grow
As the darkness moves in close
And I recognize that shadow

I don't know who I am anymore
I know I'm not who I was before
I let the reaper take control of me
And I felt all the good disappearing

Sleep, all I want is sleep
But all I see in my dreams
Wake me cause they haunting

Breathe, I just want to breathe
But my anxiety takes over me

Until I am suffocating
And my life I am hating
Cause all I am is wasting
Away I'm not worth saving

## 2020-10-31T20:41:19.000Z - GRIM FUTURE

What do you do
With a ghost in your room
And it looks just like you
And it talks like you do
But that can't be you
Unless you see through

He's waving at me
To come and set him free
What the fuck does that mean
Does he want peace
Or to inflict misery

## 2020-10-31T20:41:32.000Z - BLACKOUT

The reaper feeds off your pain
The same way you crave that novacaine
Can you hear the silence in the air
As he gets closer and fills you with fear
Now you finding out
Your time has all run out
So say goodbye to your life
There's no going back now
Breathe that last breath out
As your chest opens now
Look him in the eyes as you die
You outta time
Your body lays there lifeless
Hope you left without regrets
Shouting out loud
Where we go now
Lost the way out
I don't know how
To find the way out
Of this god damn house
The reaper pulls me back down
Under ground as I black out

## 2020-10-31T20:41:51.000Z - DOUBLE HOMICIDE

I feel the reaper taking hold of my bones
Taking me away from all I know
Where the fuck do you think you're going
It's time to be the man you were destined to be

Bitch where the fuck you going now?
I don't even know right now
Doing everything I can
but I can't tell right now

And you don't know me now
and you don't own me anyway
so get the fuck up out my way

I don't want to be who I was meant to be now
I can't take anybody's life from them
I'm not the reaper that you think I am

## 2020-10-31T20:42:14.000Z - After Dark

I just need to find some kind of light in my life

I need to know that one day everything will be fine

Cause I can never seem to ever get anything right

And lately I see no signs of hope in my sight

I'm fucking sick of all the ups and the downs

I'm tired of being lost when I just wanna be found

I need to find some peace and turn my whole damn world around

So I can finally start to make all of my children proud

I know that I have what it takes to be great

But anxiety and self doubt always get in my way

And this depression holds me hostage with a gun to my brain

Always looking for an exit when all i want is to stay

I tried to make things right but it never works out

I tried to push through the pain and get some help for myself

I tried to not give a shit about the things weighing me down

But I failed every time and now I'm starting to drown

I wish I could turn back the clock

I wish I could change who I am

But I know I can not

I wish i didn't push those who I love away

They always leave when I need them most to stay

Im sorry I'm a fuck up and I'm sorry that I'm fucked up

I'm at the point where enough is enough

There's no more hope left in my cup

I wish I knew how to fill it back up

I need to put myself back together

And understand that nothing lasts forever

I got an addiction I can't ever get passed

Every time I get close I fuck up and relapse

Feelings fade away and love ends in pain

And like the seasons people always change

You either sink or you start to swim

You can give up or you can begin again

I want to be here and strong for my daughters

And tell my son I'm sorry for being a shitty father

You three will always mean the most to me

And I hope one day you can forgive everything

## 2020-10-31T20:42:43.000Z -

Its the hardest thing ive ever had to do

To act like everything's ok in front of you

Dont know what I am supposed to do

No matter how this plays out I lose

And I'm done with it

I fucking feel like shit

I dont exist

I won't be missed

I'm always pissed

I can't resist

Howd it get to this

I'm trying to do everything the right way

But it doesn't even matter what I say

So I grab my headphones and I hit play

Until the sound of you and me fades

Pull myself back together

Cause aint shit ever last forever

## 2020-10-31T20:44:11.000Z - Bro IDK WTF Is Going On

Hey girl that ass tight
last I heard yeah your man can't fight
He's a little bitch you know right
So Let me take you out tonight

I'll come get you at 10
You and all of your friends
We gonna drink till nights end
And fuck through the whole weekend
Bitch I know you like that
When I smack that ass and
Tap that like a fuckin keg
I feel you cumin down your legs yes

## 2020-10-31T20:58:16.000Z - Don't Leave Me Here

Girl, I thought I told you
I will always love you
And be all that you want me to

Accept for dead
cause
That's where I was left
when
You were out with him
And
You chose to lie again
Yea

You don't get to run and hide
While you leave me here to die
I can't find my way without light

You use to be my beacon
All my reasons to never leave and
Stay here through every season

you just left me where I found you
It isn't fair that you don't care
cause it's not the world I belong to
My home is filled with lights
that are always shining bright
even when the day falls into night

I gave you all my light
so you'd find your way outside
Than you shut the door behind
So now I'm locked inside
The darkness of your kind

## 2020-10-31T20:59:27.000Z - DLMH PTII

I can't believe that you just left me here
You know that the dark is my biggest fear
This is where I came from
This is the home I tried to take you from

Too many demons, demons
I don't needy any reasons
To stay so I'll be leaving

Should I begin at the start

All I can see is the dark
Still right where you
tore out my heart

Too many demons here
Plenty of reasons to not stay here

The light it won't shine
into this part of your mind
Because the darkness
Wants to keep you blind1¹ a l
and I'm running out of time
before I get trapped in mine
cause you just left me here to die,
no reasons why, no goodbyes,
was it all a lie?

Girl, I thought I told you
I will always love you
And be all that you want me to
Accept for dead cause
That's where I was left

You don't get to run and hide
While you leave me here to die
I can't find my way without light

You use to be my beacon
All my reasons to never leave and
Stay here through every season

And you just left me right where I found you
It ain't fair cause it's not the world I belong to
My home is filled with lights that always shine even when the day falls to the night

## 2020-10-31T21:00:06.000Z - No Villains

If you were to write your life story, how many of you could say that you didn't have a single villain or negative person in it?

Most of us have at least one person who damaged or broke us in some way that we were never the same afterwards.

Those people were the turning point in whether we chose to hurt others as they did to us

or if we realized, we would never want the people we love, to feel the way all the people that fucked us up did

By the time my story is finished, I won't have a single villain in it because the world has enough shitty people and every person that has ever hurt me, defined me and made me into a better person each time.

So they are not villians, they are just supporting actors and actresses who helped me see a better world and live without negativity.

The best way to take away a villains superpower, is to erase their existence and turn them into something that made you a better person

## 2020-10-31T21:00:57.000Z - Miss Understood

How can I explain
the thought process
of my brain
so you understand
in the right way?

How can I escape
The way that I create
Scenarios In my brain
And turn them into reality

And turn what I made
Into reality

Into reality
They just replay
Shit I know is fake

I feel every day
When I can't face
The things I hate
That stand in my way

## 2020-10-31T21:01:24.000Z - AY FAM

Ay fam, I just wanna say
I don't wanna live in vain
I don't wanna live in pain
Why we gotta be this way?
Why can't I just let it go?
Why can't focus and grow
Why can't I spit a good flow
Why can't I stop feeling low
Why am I always a joke
To those that I love the most
And hey,
I can relate to everything you say
And hey
I cannot stay trapped in this place

## 2020-10-31T21:01:54.000Z - See You Soon

The reaper is coming,
Coming for you

The reaper is coming,
Coming for you

The reaper is coming,
Coming for you

The reaper is coming,
Yeah, see you
See you soon

My childhood was full of wonder and love
My parents loved me and showed me I was enough

Even when times got tough
we stood up and we fought
for the things we were taught l
Like kindness and love

And talked about god yeah
Above and how we rotate
around the sun yeah
Everything was going fine, yeah yeah
til I turned 35 and lost my wife, overnight to fuckin Frankenstein

And this is how it all began
When all they did was laugh
As I turned and I ran
because Something like this
Has never fucking happened
And I still dont understand

I was found in the gutter of a small little suburb
By my little brother who won't let me suffer
In the cold of the winter sometime mid December
I was so fucked up I can't remember, remember,
It's now 2 years later and I'm not any better, better
I feel the hate flow through my veins go out my temper, temper

Had a good life till I turned 35

I was born for this
not born into it
In

## 2020-10-31T21:02:49.000Z - The Abomination

Day of the wreckoning
One for remembering
Fear will be spread
When they begin to mention me

Silence be deafening
No need for questioning
Death will be prominent
Right after the sentencing

I am the Reaper
I will be known
I am relentless
Wherever I go

You cannot hide in the light
Even if you have your god by your side
The darkness is present when I have arrived
And I will not stop till you dead in my sights

I am the reaper,

Call me death greeter
And Fear is here as I linger

## 2020-10-31T21:03:18.000Z - Hypocrite Bullshit

Yeah uh huh
Fuck all of that sad shit
I didn't come back from the grave
just so that I could quit

And I guess these Haters wanna hate
Bet they wont talk shit
When they get hit right in the face

Same shit
That will never change
If all you do is bitch
instead of doin what it takes

That's what makes you fake
When all you do is waste
Away your life by never
Changing any fucking thing

I been seeing shit
Cause I've been up for the days
Been rolling from the addies
And I Been going twice the pace

Time I ain't got none to waste
So you lames better get out the way

REAPER! REAPER! REAPER!

No that's not ok
It's never to late

## 2020-10-31T21:03:31.000Z - Disaster Magnet

Damn looking back now
You did more than just let me down
Stabbed me in the back
tore my heart out
sat and laughed
while I drowned In
my self doubt
Don't want me around
Put me in the lost and found
Then pulled me back out
used me as your rebound

Just because he hurt you
Guess you're both the same
You both can't the the truth
I know you'll never change
I wish I never met you
All you brought me was pain
I'm sick of being used
Get rid of my last name

You made me so worthless
Never cared I was hurtin

You left me in the hearse
I Never been so hurt
Lost my sense of worth
And it's only getting worse

You should go to church
And get rid of your curse
The one you got from birth

Put me on the shelf
Till you need me around

Hated myself

Scream and

Made me believe I was wrong
Told me it was all my fault
So I blamed myself and hated myself
Till I was full of doubt

Tried to end my life a couple times
Wanted to end his too think I still do

## 2020-10-31T21:03:46.000Z - Light Ending

Is this really how the story ends?
Two lovers who can't even be friends

I just want you to be happy
Cause That's what I do
when I love somebody
I Don't care if you don't love me
That's just who I am
And I won't apologize for caring

Don't look so surprised
You knew that's how I was

When we kissed the first time
And we both knew it was love

I guess our fate don't align
Cause in the end we just gave up

So I guess this is goodbye
I'll See you in another life
You ain't even mine
Was it all a lie,
Why do you run and hide
Wasting your time

I need therapy for my dark mind
I just need to find some peace inside
Cause I can no longer see the light
Now all my days are the darkest nights

Just give me some drugs
So I can fall asleep
Make my body go numb
So I can't feel a thing

## 2020-10-31T21:04:57.000Z - Lights Out

Turn your eyes to the light right now
As I start to spark the fire in the dark
Turning night into day hard
When It's just me, myself and sound
singing out loud for the crowd
Tryna make my family proud
I'm sorry that I ain't been around
But I refuse to let you all down
Cause Ive been counted out
And thought that I was gonna

Drown in my depression
and all of my aggression
That I had been suppressin
guess I failed to mention
I couldn't even bare to look
at my own self reflection
So here is my confession
Took that pain and my mistakes
And made them all into lessons
To show how I had progressed
And that became my obsession
To focus on being better than I was then

I've tried my best to be
The best version of me
So my children can see
That I am not nothing

But that I am worth something
Something more than
I could even see
And I will be their guide
Whether it's through the dark
Or it's through the lightening
At time life gets freighting
and you feel like run and hiding
Till youre all alone in the dark crying
And the demons in your mind keep lying
Telling you to just give up trying

I'm only here to lift
those up who are down
When they feel like they gonna drown

I'm finally right where I'm supposed to be
Front and center on the stage of dreams
Going hard, Lightin up the dark like a star
It's been so hard but I've come so far
To not raise the bar and illuminate the way to mars

## 2020-10-31T21:05:36.000Z - Be The Light

For awhile now I've been wanting to write about this new project and where I'm going with it, but I've been so caught up in life that my direction keeps changing, my moods keep changing, honestly I don't even really know where I'm going with it or my life right now. One minute I'm doing good and that light in me is shining bright and the next minute depression comes along and knocks me off my feet and I hate all of it. I find myself questioning myself, my purpose, my worth, my choices. It's easy to stay in the light during the day but when the sun goes down, it seems I go down with it.

I will say that I'm in a much better place mentally than I was a year ago. This time last year I really didn't want to be here at all, I had no desire to live at all. I gave up and I just flat out quit. I was careless and wreckless and luckily I wanted to get help for myself and got into a rehab program for a little while but the situation I was in at the time really did give me the chance to get the help I was seeking. I found the best therapy for me was music and friends and family. If I could erase any part of my life it would be the last 2 years for sure. I know that if I could go back to April of 2017 knowing what I know now, I would have done things so much different but I guess we could all say that about something in our lives.

I spent the majority of that time writing about my marriage and how what happened to that marriage affected me, but I said everything I needed to say and probably more than I should have, I knew I needed to shift my focus

## 2020-10-31T21:06:22.000Z - Follow The Light

I think see a light up in front of me
Could it be from me, am I glowing? Am I glowing?
I find it hard to believe that I'm worth anything more than nothing, oh no

And lately I've been feeling all this weight up in my brain and I need to get away but I can't ever get away and I just know that I'm struggling yeah I'm struggling I need to move on with my life cuz it's crumbling

everyday is just the same and I've been trying to get away but I can't ever get away cause nothing ever seems to change and Im tired of the chase I need a change of pace and a break from the heartache

And I don't know where I'm supposed to go
Now that I am on my own
Can somebody guide me in the right direction?

It's time to let the light absorb me
So I can see through the darkness in me
I know I can be the light, I just need some time
It's time to let the light absorb me
So I can see through the darkness in me
I know I can be the light, I just need some time

And lately I've been feeling all this weight up in my brain and I just need to get away but I can't ever get away and I just know that I'm struggling yeah I'm struggling I need to move on with my life cuz it's crumbling

everyday is just the same and I've been trying to get away but I can't ever get away cause nothing ever seems to change and Im tired of the chase I need a change of pace and a break from the heartache

## 2020-10-31T21:06:59.000Z - Reignite Me

There's a light burning its way out of the darkness inside me
I can feel the heat and see all of the changes that it brings
I'm finally becoming the person I was always meant to be
I just want my friends and family to be proud of me

The light Sparks
And vanishes the dark

Today is a brand new day
And I'm not gonna let it go to waste
On shit from yesterday
Cause I have found a way
To live my life and be ok

There is a light
I see it glow
from the inside
Turning darkness into white
and making way for a better life

I just wanted you to know
This time I let you go
I hope you do the same

## 2020-10-31T21:07:14.000Z - I Can't Stay here

Somewhere deep within me (yea) I know
There's a fire burning in my soul
It's what drives me the most

Some days it's hard to see my self worth
Depression got me hostage in a hearse
Been that way since birth, am I cursed?

I can't stay here, stay here
Trapped inside my worst fears
The darkness is trying
To make all my light disappear

And I don't want to be here, be here. Oh no

I can't stay here, stay here
Trapped inside my worst fears
The darkness is trying
To make all my light disappear

And I don't want to be here, be here. Oh no

Somewhere deep within me (yea) I hold
The key to let all of my fears go
And stop giving them control

I just need to light the way back home
Even if it means being alone
I need to be on my own

I can't stay here, stay here
I'm getting rid of my fears
The darkness, it won't take me
When my light reappears

I will find my light
I'll take back my life
I will be your guide
When you get lost inside

I can't stay here, stay here
I'm getting rid of my fears
The darkness, it won't take me
When my light reappears

I will find my light
I'll take back my life
I will be your guide
When you get lost inside

There is a light
I can see it my sights
I know the darkness
Isn't very far behind

I can feel the dark
As it's aiming for my heart

## 2020-10-31T21:07:27.000Z - Signal Flares

To the world I'm just locked inside my room
But really I'm locked inside my head of doom
All black walls, all dark thoughts,
ghosts that haunt got me cold like frost

and I'm scared
that I won't find my way out
Cause I can't see anything
but the dark inside me right now

Where do I go when there's nowhere to go
Where do I go when I can't find my way out
No key, I can't see anything,
so dark, black walls, all these dark thoughts now.
lead me out.

Im so cold
I just need a coat now
I just need some help now
Do you hear me
I'm sending out flares now
Can you come and find me?

## 2020-10-31T21:07:46.000Z - Desolate Me

It all started with something about myself
I'm always looking for a place that I can go
And I don't even know
Tell you how I'm feeling inside
And I don't know what I'm trying to do anymore
Looking for an exit while I'm going through the door
But I've been steady pacing
Since I reformed my own ways
My own mind try to do it all right
Try to make it on time oh no
Tell me where do I go?

## 2020-10-31T21:08:07.000Z - Uv Blue

Lie to me, please lie to me
Please lie to me, please lie to me
Make me believe I am worth nothing
My thoughts they hauntin
They are not stoppin
Migraines are throbbin
It happens often
You keep on watchin
Hopin I drop in
down in my coffin

Lie to me, please lie to me
Please lie to me, please lie to me
And Make me believe
That Everything
Is Not what it seems
But it's what it seems
Cause it's what I see
And I need a drink
Just let go of me
So I can be free
And finally breathe
You're not what I need

## 2020-10-31T21:08:21.000Z - The light in Your Dark

Have you ever lost yourself to somebody you love?
Have you ever felt like you were never enough?
Have you ever been so down staring at that bottle tryna drown?
That was my life then, this is my life now
Cause you see, eventually
you gotta pick up all the pieces
of who you used to be
And put it yourself back together
So you can be better than ever
And I ain't gonna lie
It's gonna take some time
To get yourself back into that right mind
But I promise if you try and try
Everything's gonna be alright

Just take my hand and I'll show you how to get there
I'll light the dark so there's no reason to be scared
Don't give up, don't give up on me now
I will lead you out I promise

## 2020-10-31T21:08:59.000Z - The Ever Glow

If You ask me how I'm doin,
I'm a tell you that I'm fine
I'm a mess but still I keep on going
In search of how to finally be the light

Lately I've been thinking
That maybe I just need a change of pace
and something to believe In

Cause my mind been feeling vacant
And my thoughts they just keep on wastin...away

And I'm not tryna fade
I'm tryna glow and be great,
rid out all the hate,
change all of my ways
so nothing stays the same
find a better place
so that I can light the way

Depression is a struggle
That leads to mental trouble

away and
I just need a taste of something that's not fake and something that I can just take in and feel whole again

## 2020-10-31T22:19:32.000Z - REAPING SEASON

I feel the anger start to grow
As the darkness moves in close
And I recognize that shadow

I don't know who I am anymore
I know I'm not who I was before
I let the reaper take control of me
And I felt all the good disappearing

Sleep, all I want is sleep
But all I see in my dreams
Wake me cause they haunting

Breathe, I just want to breathe
But my anxiety takes over me

Until I am suffocating
And my life I am hating
Cause all I am is wasting
Away I'm not worth saving

## 2020-10-31T22:20:30.000Z - Stacking Bodies

It's just me, myself and Reap
Jamming in the Jeep
Riding down the side street
Getting ready to release
The soul of our next body
Put em 6 ft deep

Just another day and night
As the body counts stack high
.

## 2020-10-31T22:23:10.000Z - The Abomination

Day of the wreckoning
One for remembering
Fear will be spread
When they begin to mention me

Silence be deafening
No need for questioning
Death will be prominent
Right after the sentencing

I am the Reaper
I will be known
I am relentless
Wherever I go

You cannot hide in the light
Even if you have your god by your side
The darkness is present when I have arrived
And I will not stop till you dead in my sights

I am the reaper,

Call me death greeter
And Fear is here as I linger

## 2020-10-31T22:23:54.000Z - Hypocrite Bullshit

Yeah uh huh
Fuck all of that sad shit
I didn't come back from the grave
just so that I could quit

And I guess these Haters wanna hate
Bet they wont talk shit
When they get hit right in the face

Same shit
That will never change
If all you do is bitch
instead of doin what it takes

That's what makes you fake
When all you do is waste
Away your life by never
Changing any fucking thing

I been seeing shit
Cause I've been up for the days
Been rolling from the addies
And I Been going twice the pace

Time I ain't got none to waste
So you lames better get out the way

REAPER! REAPER! REAPER!

No that's not ok
It's never to late

## 2020-10-31T22:24:32.000Z - ---

I'm finally starting to see that light
That I have always had down inside
Told you I was finally gonna shine
I'm a star down here don't need the sky

Now I can turn the night into day
Remove all the dark and be okay

I don't need anyone to tell me what I'm worth
I got more heart than most guess that's why I'm always hurt

## 2020-10-31T22:26:03.000Z - Ending

I don't know where to go
all I know is that I'm losing control of my soul
and I don't want to lose myself anymore to you

All this time that I spent
wondering where you have been
I wasted all my time
just to watch you give yourself to someone else
yeah I know that I'm not perfect
but I had given everything I could to you
and look what you did
yeah you took my heart
pulled it straight out of my chest
and I don't know where to fucking go
I'm honestly broken
and I can't be saved
words left on replay
they're cutting right through me now

And some days
I don't know what I'm to believe
cuz everything you told me is exactly what I wanted to hear from you

when you open your mouth
you drown me out

But this isn't anything new,
anything new oh no
all these nights alone
feeling so low
so cold waiting by the phone
but you don't ever answer me
no, no

And I wish that I could take all my time back,
wish you hadn't ended things like that, things like that.
All these days are the same
and I just try to get away
but shit just stays the same and
I don't want to go back now
I don't want to go back
just leave me here to die this time

These days I don't know what to believe
you tell me that I still mean nothing
I don't believe that it's true
I just think what you're going through
is something you can't handle
you don't need me there
but you say I don't matter
cuz it ain't even fair
all this time I've tried
just to get you out my mind

What's the word mean
when you say "forever" to me?
Yeah was it all worth it
was he worth it?
cuz you got me feeling
so damn worthless
Yea oh feeling so alone
got my heart turning cold
and I'm feeling so cold
turn my heart into stone
you know I don't deserve this

## 2020-10-31T22:26:23.000Z - Starting Over

It's about time that I dig myself out of the grave you left me in,
it's about time I move on with my life, so I can begin again.
Cause Life is what you make it and I don't want to hate it.
I know that I must face it, cause shit I cannot change it.

I take my thoughts and I turn them into songs.
Try to paint a picture of how my life it all went wrong.
And I try to tell myself that I have to stay strong.
And convince myself somehow that I do belong.

## 2020-10-31T22:27:48.000Z - Graveyard Shift

It's about time I dig myself out of the grave you left me in,
it's about time I move on with my life so I can begin again.
Cause Life is what you make it and I don't want to hate it.
I know that I must face it, cause shit I can't change it.
you made mine hell,
But I am still alive and I'm doing well
The way you left me made me wanna kill myself
But my friends and family saved me and I got some help.

It's about time that I see you for all the things that you really are.
It's about time that I shut that door and get a divorce, it's not that hard.
You were never there for me, you know it's true,
Always ran away when I needed you.
And now that I want no part of you,
I'm writing you off, singing out fuck you.

Move on, move along, get the fuck out of my way
I got big plans these days and I'm gonna be great
Don't care what you say, cause all you are is fake
And two faced, stabbed me in the back and put me in a grave now your apologies are too late

## 2020-10-31T22:28:23.000Z - Starting Over

## 2020-10-31T22:28:55.000Z - The Last Letter I'll Write to You as My Wife

Hey Stevie, are you out there?
Can you hear me? Am I loud and clear?

How have you been? Is everything ok? Did you find love again? Is your life better this way?

Do you smile more? Do you cry less?
Is your mind at war? Are you feeling stressed?

What's new with you? Are you different now? Have you found yourself??

Can you sleep at night? Do you ever think of me? Does he treat you right? Are you really happy?

Did you find yourself? Do you smile more? Do you have regrets? Did you find what you were looking for?
Do you ever look back? Do you ever second guess? ? Am I still second best?

Do you remember that night at B&N back in November when we first met? You pulled me close so you could kiss me I was so nervous I couldn't breath.

Looking back now what would you have changed? Would you still love me or would I be erased? I hope you know I'll always miss your face, I hope you'd find love in yourself some day

Honestly for me, I wouldn't change a thing, I'd travel back in time to relive every memory. Maybe then you'd see, how much you meant to me and maybe then you'd never have given up on me. But that's just a fantasy that I'd much rather believe cause sometimes the painful thought of reality is just too unbearable for me. I hope youre happy, I hope you found yourself this time, I'm sorry that I was boring

You always wanted me to chase you well look what I'm doing
You always wanted a song so just listen to what I'm singing

You said I only cared after it was too late
But baby I cared about you every single day
I hope you don't ever forget about me
cuz I don't want to be a forgotten memory
I wish things could have been different maybe they still could be but we'll never know cuz that's something you refuse to believe. This is your song, one I hope that you'll sing. I wish we could have had a better ending. You'll always be my favorite melody, you'll always live inside these harmonies. I love you forever and always, till death do us part whether you're buried beside me

I've been trying to let go of you, inside I'm dying cause I don't want to

I know we don't speak unless you need something from me. I miss you every day that's fucking sad to say. Guess this marriage meant something but to you it meant nothing

Baby I'm sorry it took so long, I know you're gone but please don't move on, please hang on, I feel so lost this all feels wrong.

Tell me I'm still sleeping, tell me that I'm just dreaming and when the morning comes you'll be wrapped up in the blankets with me

Tell me you still love me, tell me I'm not crazy
Tell me it's not the end, tell me we're still a family,
tell me everything is still the same, tell me we didn't get divorced and you still have my last name.
Please wake me up from this hell
you promised me forever, this can't be real
Baby is this real? Are you really gone?
Are we out of touch? Did our signals get lost?
Oh God reality is setting in, this is it, this is the end. The end of everything that had anything to do with you and me. Baby I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. You're too far out of reach, I can't see you, I can't feel you, I can't hold you. Where are you, who are you now? Are you out there? Can you hear me? How did we lose touch? How did you get to where you're at? Oh God this is the end, I feel my heart sinking in, I know I have to let you go but I don't know how, you're all I know, where do I go? What will I do without you? Who am I when I'm without you? Baby I'm sorry, I'm losing my grip, I know this is the end. Goodbye my love, this time I accept the truth, I'll sign those papers on the dotted line and begin a new life without you.

There's no more time, I'll see you in anotherlife

Baby I'm sorry, baby please don't leave
Come and rescue me, like that song we use to sing,

Baby I'm struggling, baby I'm drowning I must be dreaming you said you'd never leave me

This can't be real, please wake me up
Please tell me we're still in love
I'm in our room but where are you?
This is our house but it's empty now

Get me out of this place, I can't be awake grab my hand and show me the way
I can't see your face this is a mistake
What about fate? you're my soulmate

Don't let me go, please don't let me go
Where are you? why can't you hear me?
If this is a dream than why am I not sleeping?
Why am I back at our first house? Why is there no trace of you here? This is a dream
I'm just walking in my sleep. None of this is real, I'm back in Marshall at 816, I'm upstairs asleep, trapped inside a dream I have to be please baby wake me up, I've never been so lost. Give me a sign that you're alright, tell me we're fine, tell me you're here by my side, tell me I'm in a coma from the other night there was an accident and I'm trapped inside

Nothing makes sense, memories of another life keep flashing by but that can't be right because I see you with some other guy and I see myself alone at night, it looks like we don't even talk anymore, why do we not speak to eac...

## 2020-10-31T22:29:22.000Z - Neverending

I hope that you're ok this time around
I hope that you're alright, that you're ok

Call my name out loud, Hear me now

One thing that I feel
is always gonna be real
To deal with, I know it

Is It's hard to fucking feel
anything, anymore without you

I still love you
And I feel it in my bones
When I'm without you

## 2020-10-31T22:29:37.000Z - Dayone

Day one of my new life
No more looking back this is goodbye
Time to focus on the dark to bring forth light
Shedding tears, shedding fears, it's gon be alright
I talked to God he gave me a sign
Told him imma get it right this time

Need to focus on being a better man
So I can give a 💯 everywhere I am

## 2020-10-31T22:30:07.000Z - Constant

Hey I got nothing but love for you, all I want is to see you succeed and be happy, with or without me. With that being said, Idk wtf is going through your head anymore, you're so god damn lost and numb that you can't even see the shit your doing to those around you sometimes . I just want you to figure your life out and be yourself. I honestly believe that you and I have grown into two completely different people, two completely incompatible people and that really sucks and it's not fair for either one of us but that party life and shit is over for me, I understand you never got to live it but for meI only did it because I didn't have anything else at the time now I got three awesome children, and priorities I need to get straight. I'm not judging you be whoever you want and do whatever you want. I want to be able to talk to you about anything and everything and have us grow to be good friends hopefully, but in the meantime you got to stay away. No more asking to smoke a cigarette with me or hanging out or doing music and shit I just can't handle it if fucks me up and then it makes it so I fuck your shit up. I think part of you has been holding on because maybe you're thinking one of these days you're going to wake up and snap out of the hell you're living in or the way you're seeing things but the reality is what is this is just who you are and deep down we're not the same anymore and you just can't love me like you used to. I've been coming to terms with it this whole time, I really don't think if I had a better job and my own place, that things would really be that much different with you and me. I know I got a lot of soul-searching to do and I need to find myself and find life after you. The shit is so hard and fucking sad and depressing to think that we will probably never be buried together, but if that means that you find happiness someplace else instead of being buried next to somebody your miserable with, then that's what I want for you. I'm always going to love you and right now it's hard for you to love anything and I feel like I'm just getting my heart stabbed over and over again. So please no more hanging out till you figure your shit out. I'll always be around if you need me and you need to talk or need help. I'm really not going to bother you anymore, cuz I can't make you love me and I can't do anything about the situation we're in right now

## 2020-10-31T22:31:03.000Z - Reset

My last project "Hit The Reset" was all about the negativity of where my life has been and the shit I went through during the last 2 years of my life. This new project I started is currently titled "Be The Light" and it is about where my life is at right now and not where I want to go but where I am going to go. I'm choosing to focus more on the positive things in life and how I've begun to light the way out of my own darkness. Never thought that I would ever grow this much musically nor did I ever see myself as a vocalist who could ever carry half a tune without autotune. As with Hit The Reset, this project is still very much about me and for me but I know soon I will be able to reach out to others who can relate and are searching for their own way out of the darkness they struggle with every day. I am still very much struggling with the same issues and the shit I was with HTR but I can't wait to show you a different perspective on the same issues or the same people. A personal goal should always be to better yourself every day. That's where I'm going and that's where you'll find me

## 2020-10-31T22:31:52.000Z - You’ll Float Too

Girl why you hit my phone,
After leaving me alone?
What is there say
When there ain't shit or
Anything you can change?

What's done is done
All that love is gone
Made me feel I don't belong
That I was always wrong
When you know that we both at fault
But I am the wound, you are the salt

And I was always in the wrong

Round and round we always go
Tried so hard to let you go
& the second we end up alone
I'm a mess and I lose control

The greatest story never known
But I just want you to know
Although broken you were my only home
Now I don't know where to go
Don't know how to cope
Find me in the storm drain below
Cause down here we all float
how to fucking cope
When the pain it grabs ahold
and my life it starts to choke
feel like hanging by a rope
I should matter but I don't
as it rains I go for a stroll
And I grab my yellow coat
And like Georgie I will float
Just Like that paper boat

I wish you that could change
But I know you won't
Our fate is has been told
And that box will stay closed
If you still care at all
I hope you never let me know

Please don't call me anymore
Please don't act like I'm alive
Please forget my fucking face
Please just hate me all the time

It's the only way I can move on
It's our only chance to be happy
So I'll play like I'm dead and gone
So you can finally set us free

as it rains, out the door I go
But not without my yellow coat
Cause down here we all float
Just like that paper boat
The one my brother made
Right before I met my fate

If you're Pennywise,
than I must be a ghost
Legend goes
that down here we all float
Guess now I know,
Tell my brother
That he gotta let me go

Fucking clown, I hate you now but you already know

Just Like that paper boat
If you're pennywise, than I must be ghost
Cause I found myself trapped down in this hole

You can drag me down a hole
But you won't get my soul
Cause my heart is made of gold
And this story will be told
Stephen king already knows
It's his story I rewrote

## 2020-10-31T22:32:53.000Z - Flames

Love of mine,
what's going through your mind?
Cause It's always you that's all up in mine.
I wish I could erase the last two years of our lives
cause we failed and tried and could never get it right
But I swear this time, things will turn out work out fine
Cause you are my only home and you'll be my only wife cause baby yeah you're my whole life and I love you. I'll always love you.

Fuck the past, let's burn it with a match.
I know that we cannot act like we didn't do shit that we cannot take back and you know that's a fact but I still love you through all of that,

every imperfection, every misconception, every flaw, every moment I loved you through it all and this time if you fall, I'll be there to catch you cause this time I'll stand tall

and I won't ever let you down again cause you know that you're my best friend and that will never change even when I'm buried in the cemetery weather together with our names on the same grave.

Till death do us part you've always had my heart, right from the start.

We both made mistakes, we both have shit we need to change, we both got issues that we need to face and I'm ready this time I'll do anything,
Just to wake up everyday to that beautiful face. You're my saving grace and I'll always want you more each and every day and that won't ever change cause I love you I'll always love you

I try to pass the time by reminiscing on our life.
I know we fell apart cause we never could get it right
but I swear on everything we can make it work this time
I gave up on myself and I let you down,
You tried to hold me up when you were starting to drown

## 2020-10-31T22:33:27.000Z - Meet You in Montauk

This is temporary, everything that surrounds me.
This feeling of depression is a lesson I couldn't see.
Needed space to grow, needed room to breathe.
I'm turning something out of nothing just watch me

I'm done with all the blame and done with all the hate
Done with everything that has kept me in place
I take my pain and the things I cannot change
and use it to create a better way cause that's my fate.

I am a light, I'm here to guide you, I'm here to show you there's more to life than what they told you

## 2020-10-31T22:34:07.000Z - **

I have this recurring dream every night
That I'm in another life and you're at my bedside
I hear our kids calling out for mom and dad
As they rush in our rooms and nobody is sad

I feel loved, I feel enough, I feel like I hit a gold Rush
Life isn't rough, I feel your touch there's no better outcome

I'm back at my old job perfect attendance and all
Got my own office with our family picture on the wall
And my mom called just to say she was proud of me
And that I was so blessed to have such a loving family

This is it, I finally made it, I achieved everything I've been chasin
I've never been so high, I feel so alive coming home to those I love every night

And just as I get in the drive way I hear the radio turn to static
And I when I look up I see our house has turned into nothing but ashes
And there's a siren going off as if to warn me to find somewhere safe
And as I start to run the ground begins to fold by an earthquake
And by then it's too late cause im falling down to what must be my fate
And just before death takes me, I see my wife tell me it's time for me to awake

I open my eyes and there's no one at my bedside
And now I really wish that dream was real and I had just died
Nobody knows me better than my own mind, so why does it want me to hate my life

Just let me sleep, let me be happy in that dream for eternity.

## 2020-10-31T22:34:55.000Z - It's time that I Let Go

Where do I go at night when I'm all alone
And you're no where to be found?
Late nights keep me awake for so long, so long now.
When am I going to ever find myself man?
When am I going to get some help for myself?
I just need to find my way again.

Fighting through the pain almost everyday, I just need to get away, don't you think?
Don't you think it's about time that I just get my life right for once so I can move along?

Tell me now!

I just need to clear my head and need to get my life right again.

I don't know why I'm fuckin Killin time.
I hope that you're doing fine this time.
Wake up tell me that you care
and tell me that you gonna be there and look at me now and telling me how all this shit is in my brain, I know, it's time to take control of everything that I know I know that I need to get back on my feet and.....

So if you were to ask me if I would do it all over again
the answer is always going to be the same absolutely.
my greatest memory was that day we met at Barnes and Nobles parking lot
and you came walking up in that yellowcard shirt with those cute ass boots on. I was so fucking nervous that I just looked stupid probably.

You asked me if you could kiss me and I've been fucked up ever since.

I really hope you know
that I'm trying now
To let it all go right out
To find some peace and move on now
This shit is killing me
It's killing me

I know I've been so hard to be around
You can hear it in my voice as I lose it now
When all I do is scream & shout
Cuz I feel like you can't hear me now

What is love without trust
Without trust there isn't much
What is love without trust
Without trust there isn't much

Do I give up?
Do I say all the things
That made me the person that I never wanted to be?

Do I give a fuck? Yea
I really give a fuck now
Imma get it right
Imma get right with my life this time
Imma get it right
Swear to God I'm going to get it right this time, this time
Imma get right with my life this time
Imma get it right, right, right
And I'll see you in another life
I'm gonna get this right
And I'll see you in another life
I'm gonna get it right
Swear to God this time
I'm gonna get it right

## 2020-10-31T22:35:21.000Z - ***---

Never thought that I'd be here
Singing all these songs
About my life
And how it a went wrong
Told me that I was nothing
They made me feel so small
crawled up from the bottom
Now im standing 6 ft tall

Did it all from mom's house
thankful for my moms help
When I was down and out
She helped me find myself

This time I'm coming for the throne
with my hands around your throat
Just so I can watch you choke

Everyone's a critic
In their own way

Especially if they
don't like the same shit

## 2020-11-01T01:06:43.586Z - Everett

She said "this is for the best, I dont care if you think I'm being selfish"
I replied with "How do you know what's best, when we both know he doesn't understand this?"
She said "I don't care what you think, cause come December we are moving out of this state"
I replied with "I'll never understand how you could be so damn cold when were so close"

Three years later and everything's the same, I've spent everyday blaming myself for things I couldn't change.

What does he say when he's over there, does he ask you if I even care?
What do you tell him about me?
Do you say that I'm doing my best or that I'm just a loser like all the rest?
What will it take to make this right?

## 2020-11-01T02:21:26.031Z - Reject

I should change my name to reject.
I wasted so much time trying to hit the reset,
On the shit I can't forget, that list of regrets,
The times that we have spent, all the words that I have said,
They were useless but they're replaying in my head.
I confess, yeah that my life's a mess, I feel so useless
And I openly admit I find it hard to give a shit,
When every day that I sit alone I just wanna quit,
But I don't do it cause I'm so used to this.
I just keep going in hopes that it's not all pointless.

Is anybody listening or am I talking to myself again?
Man I miss my friends, but I don't deserve them cause I've been a worse friend.
I just want someone to care and to always be there,
Through sickness and in health, even if we poor or we got wealth, through good days and through the worst days in hell.

## 2020-11-01T02:25:23.298Z - In Loving Memory

You had my fathers middle name
Because I knew that you'd be great
That you would spread the light of love
Even if those closest weren't blood

I had this picture in my mind
Of what our family would be like
3 boys and your mother, my wife
Playing in the yard and flying kites

September began with bad news
Our beautiful baby gone too soon

I hope you're watching from above
You will always be loved

And I'm not one to pray but if praying brings us closer then I will pray everyday. I know you can hear me as I play so I will play till my hands ache. I will sing to you this song until my voice breaks and I hope you'll hum along.

You had my fathers middle name
And I swear that you were just as great.

You had my head of hair
Brown and grizzly like a bear
Enough to keep you warm
During the winters toughest storm

## 2020-11-01T21:54:30.000Z - Status

Listen a lot has happened in the last few days. I've been to places mentally that I don't like to go but I had to go there to be able to get the fuck out of bed every day. I feel like I'm getting to that point of not giving a fuck and I want to keep giving a fuck.

I fear that I will never make it out of my mom's with this job and with my license situation. I can't move forward without some kind of miracle or some outside help. I'm not putting that outside help on you either. I'll never make you carry my weight ever again.

I know you are cursed with not being able to forget anything, especially the bad things, I guess I'm cursed with being able to forget a lot of things or maybe I'm not forgetting them but actually letting those wounds heal because I choose to live through those things instead of hiding them or running from them. I don't know.

I never wanted to lose you and I never wanted you to lose yourself. We have been through so much together, more than most people have their entire lives, both good and bad. I don't see a way of us getting out of our situations without something life changing or altering happening and the only conclusion or solution I have is to let you go. Despite all my feelings, all my love, how sick it makes me to not be with you, I know that I am the only one who can break us out of this loop so you can be the person and the mother you really want to be.

I don't want to let you go Stevie. I told you back when we first got together that I just knew you were it for me. There's nobody after you and I mean it now just as I did then, if not more. I want you to be able to have a better life for yourself and for the girls and I know the only way that is possible is to be able to have a clean slate and fresh start with someone whom you can build a new life with.

All I am or have become to you is either a reminder of how much I hurt you back than and how it's my fault I made you who you are now or I'm just going to be a constant reminder of all of your mistakes and you will never escape this cycle of doom. I don't see any happy endings for myself because this isn't what I want but I'm finally putting the wants and needs of you and the children before my own for once.

I don't know how we're going to get through this at all, I can't hardly function as it is, but I do know that every time the dust settles, even after only a few days. That law of attraction goes into full effect and it keeps pulling us back in. I would continue this loop forever if It means that every few months I get to see you and be with you for just one more day over and over but I have to stop being so selfish of what I want. We are both more than our mistakes and I would do anything and everything thing I could to right my wrongs for you.

I'm not going to play it off like I'm not hurt for the things that's happened the last few months, especially when I've been trying to go 💯 on the fact that I just wanted you to be real and be honest with me regardless of my feelings. Maybe I could have found a way to save us if I knew how you really felt about me and what you really felt about Tyler. You are a good person stevie, who makes mistakes just like everyone else. And I know after you got with Tyler you thought you were doing the right thing because it was different and you didn't want to throw our marriage away for something that wasn't real and concrete in your soul. I also know you hated the way you went about things and kept coming back to repair them so you could feel like you were doing the right thing. I don't ever want to be someone you want for any other reason accept because that's what you really want. None of that because it was familiar and comfortable shit, or you felt bad or guilty for me. Fuck that, all that shit did was fuck me up even more cause it just made me question how you felt about me even more.
I don't know where to go or what to do anymore all I know is I have to find any and every way to stay out of your life and leave you alone so you can move on and be happy

## 2020-11-01T21:56:27.000Z - The Anniversary

Will this always keep ending the same?
Can we change? Can we move past our mistakes? What will it take?
How much more of our hearts have to break?
Should we just give up? Should we just quit, say enough is enough and fuck this shit?

I’ll never give up on you,
but you don’t see the hell im going through, I’m doing my best and I feel at times you could care less
We’re both a mess, I want you
but you want me to confess
all of my crimes during that awful time
in our lives

What’s done is done,
we can’t change the past,
but a constant reminder of it
will only prove that we won’t last

We are more than our mistakes
More than the times we have failed
You know I’ll do whatever it takes
As long as your ship hasn’t sailed
It takes effort from both of us
Relationships won’t work without trust
I still see the good inside of you
Can you see the good inside me too?

I share an equal blame,
50% of the overall pain,
half of our mistakes,
Shit I can’t explain

We both need to change
We both need comfort when our eyes begin to rain
We both need to release the negativity from our brain
We both need to stop washing all the good down the drain

I can’t live thinking I am the sole cause to all of this
In this story we are both victims and villains
I’m no better than you, you’re no worse than me.
I just don’t know what the fuck to do,
I can’t make you see what you don’t want to.
I can’t keep taking all the punches you threw
I can’t take what’s been broken and make it new.
So what do I do? What do I do with this life of me and you?

Will this always keep ending the same?
Can we change? Can we move past our mistakes? What will it take?

## 2020-11-01T21:58:36.000Z - Grave Digger

They say happiness is the best revenge. I’ll never believe in that garbage. The best revenge is when you show them their biggest mistake was believing you could never do anything to get out from the castle they built on top of you and that they never should have never doubted you and brick by brick you remove as they continue to joke about you. I’ve been patient, Waiting till the time is right when they think you are finally gone and you pull the last brick out and show them they were wrong. Don’t underestimate the person you tried to bury, cause nothing but time exists down in that cemetery. Happiness is revenge and I will be there to tell everyone how it ends. Grave digger, you should have dug that grave a little deeper. Should have finished what you started,

With every passing day the wind blows a little more on this ocean I have made and before long its going to cause a tidal wave and in the middle of that will be your name. So enjoy your happiness today because eventually that happiness will be buried in my old grave

With every passing day the wind blows a little more on this ocean I have made and before long its going to cause a tidal wave and in the middle of that will be your name. So enjoy your happiness today because eventually that happiness will be buried in my old grave

Last year I was such a mess but this year I will get my revenge because there will be no peace between us three until I get back the life you stole from me

Grave Digger, you should have buried me a lot more deeper
Betrayer, its time for you to take my place in that casket you put me in.

## 2020-11-01T22:00:52.000Z - Closing The Final Chapter

I’ve been such a sad soul, I know.
Stay up late every night losing control
Watching my life pass by all alone
And the status of my future unknown

I’ve become so bitter, so cold
My heart is now made of snow
Every beat pumps out an icy flow
Until everything around me is froze

Been trying for months now to let you go
You buried me alive six feet down below
All I am now is a dim glow casting shadows
A hollow shell with no place I can call home

I’ve lost so much I’ve got nothing to show
I worked so hard to build everything you stole

I’m takin my time I’m takin what’s mine
Rebuilding my life one day at a time
Telling myself I don’t need help
Need nobody else to fix

Cause I’m just a ghost of my old self,
floating through life like I’m just dust on a shelf,
I know you think writing these songs just wont help
but you’ll never know what I felt
when I had been giving the cards that I was dealt.

I write these songs cause they are my stories to tell,
like that day back in May when I had lost all hope in myself, cause if my own wife didn’t want me
than why would anyone else?

## 2020-11-01T22:03:11.000Z - 55

Woke up to another day
But everything still the same
All I feel is pain all I am is suffering
Doesn’t matter if it’s sunny or it rains

Ok here I go just wanna tell you that I love you fore I’m through cause I don’t know what to do I’m so god damn lost without you don’t know why I even care cause you’re not even here you’re with that piece of shit that I can’t stand a pathetic excuse for a man and you don’t give a damn so why should I?

It’s been 55 days since you left me here
55 days I’ve been fucked up you don’t care

Dear whoever if your listening than I’m sorry to bother you with all my fucking problems but I don’t know how to solve them and I don’t know who I am cause I got lost inside a lie and I just wanna die

My life’s a mess like my room and my bed
Like the thoughts up in my head that tell me Id be better dead and all those words you said got me seeing red got me so full of regret that I just want to forget you and everything you ever meant

They say hell is what you make it but I never created this,

From time to time (yea)
you’re still on my mind (yea)
I’ve been doing fine
but we both know that’s a lie
cause when I think of you
I still fucking cry
You took away my life
And you left me here to die
When you were my wife
You fucked another guy
Staying out every night
Drinking and getting high
Starting shit and causin fights
And that shit wasn’t right

This shit just wasn’t fair
Knowing you don’t even care
Knowing you’d rather be there
Than coming back here

You were everything to me
And you’re still in all my dreams
Only now you’re haunting me
So these days I don’t even sleep
And I can’t even breathe
Got so much fucking anxiety
I feel like it’s choking me
Fuck you both you’re dead to me

## 2020-11-01T22:04:47.000Z - The Crow

This is my story to tell And I will tell it well
So that one day our daughters will see
What really happened between you and me
Cause I know you better than you think I do
How you believe your own stories when they’re not true
Or how you mislead the world to believe I never loved you
How you stabbed me in the back and dug me my own grave
So you could be with that fuckboy and there wouldn’t be shit I could say

I bet you never thought I’d climb out from your cemetery
Guess next time you should make sure the dead stay buried
Cause now me you and Tyler have a score to settle
And I ain’t got shit to lose since I traded my soul for yours to the devil

Yea him and I made a deal a few years back, cause I was doing everything I could to try and save you
Cause I loved you and I gave you everything that I knew how to, and if that meant after this life I had to live without you, well at least I could enjoy the rest of this life spent with you.

Funny how things turned out, funny how you laughed when I hit the ground, funny how you felt so proud to see me drown
in all the tears I cried, day after day, night after night,
Gasping for air, grasping for light

and I wanted to give up because I couldn’t live with the fact I was never enough,
I almost let myself go back to hell with the devil and my soul.

But something pulled me up out of that grave, something told me I couldn’t let you get away with all the crimes you committed along the way,

This is my story to tell And I will tell it well
So that one day our daughters will see
What really happened between you and me
Cause I know you better than you think I do
How you believe your own stories when they’re not true

But something pulled me up out of that grave, something told me I couldn’t let you get away with all the crimes you committed along the way,

cause karma doesn’t always come for the bad ones, and judging by your actions I knew your killing spree had just begun. So I took it upon myself to be the karma that evades you and know that this time ain’t shit that’s going to save you, cause I’m coming to collect on what you took from me, there ain’t shit you can do to stop me cause I’m hellbent on revenge and when the time comes for me to go back to hell, I’m taking you with me and I’m trading your soul back for mine cause I know to the devil yours is worth a lot more than mine. So for now I hope this message is loud and clear. The truth will be set free soon enough my dear. Better pack your shit and move to the next planet cause your time here is over once everyone knows who you really are, call me karma, call me asshole call me your biggest regret. But it won’t change a thing when you get to the place where your meant.

## 2020-11-01T22:06:35.000Z - Winter In Hell

As the snow begins to fall
so do my hopes of us ever getting along
cause I just can’t forgive what you’ve done
you were always my favorite song

but now that song is dead and gone
Just like that time when we lost our son
And this all feels so wrong
There were lines you crossed
How do I stay strong
When I feel so lost
All I did was try
All you did was lie
never said goodbye
When you fucked that guy
No I’m not alright
And we’ll never be fine
Guess I’ll see you in anotherlife

you’re as cold as the winter is outside
the blizzard that froze over my life
On paper you’re still my wife
just not anymore in this life
Cause my wife, yea she died, when she put that knife in my back,

buried in the cemetery weather
just like that dream we once had together
Back when you always promised forever
There never was a happy ever after

Am I getting through to you yet Stevie?
Do you not see all the shit you’ve done to me?
Are you always going to play the victim
when I was never the villain?

All I did was love you, I traded my soul so I could save you,
you always wanted me to fight for you,
all I fucking did was fight for you
And with you and on and on it was all for nothing

All I wanted was for us to have a family,
you knew how much that shit meant to me.
Look what you’re doing to our daughters,
the last thing I want is for them to grow up like their mother.

I know you don’t want to hear what I have to say
but I’m so sick of feeling this way,
I’m so sick of all my thoughts being of your face,
I’m so sick of reliving all of your mistakes.

I’m so sick of losing sleep,
cause I believed all of the promises you made to me.
I never wanted to hate you,
I never wanted to write these songs about you.
But what choice did you give me

Let's get fucked up
Off of drunk love
Fill these cups up
Can't get enough

Let's get so fucked up
that we can fly
Pop some Addy's
Well chase it with the high

Hi,
bitch bye.
No longer need you by my side
cuz I'm coming down
from this cloud
and I'm never going
to need you now

I stroll into the party like I fucking own it
Sippin that bicardi as my homies roll in
Fuck a gold chain fuck your gold teeth
I got a fucking strut to put all eyes on me
Walkin
Bitch stop talkin
Or end up in a coffin
It happens often
We ballin
Ballin
I think yo mommas callin
So stop talkin
Get to walkin

Let's get fucked up
Off of drunk love
Fill these cups up
Can't get enough

Let's get so fucked up
that we can fly
Pop some Addy's
Well chase it with the high

Hi,
bitch bye.
No longer need you by my side
cuz I'm coming down
from this cloud
and I'm never going
to need you now

Walk into the club like I just don't give a fuck
Got my Entourage and we gonna fuck shit up
Grab your friends and let's get drunk
Keep the bottles coming like you will be when I'm done

I'm a bad dude and yous a bad bitch
You Got that booty like a fuckin scratch and sniff
Light it up and take a hit
Nobody better than who you fucking with

Party all night till the sunrise
All these lines got me feeling so right
Man I'm so high, girl you so fly
put your body on my body baby all night

## 2020-11-01T22:08:04.000Z - Last Transmission

This is the last time I'll ever write to you .
This is the last time I'll ever sing for you.
This is the last time I'll ever cry for you.
This is the last time I'll hurt because of you.
This is the last time I'll hate myself for you.
This is the last time I'll blame myself for you.
This is the last time I'll kill myself over you.
This is the last time I'll be consumed by you.

It's all said and done, you chose to run and I'm fucked up,
feels like I don't belong, It all feels wrong, you want me dead and gone.
And It's been so long that I have seen the sun,
Cause to me you were my only one,
but now you only live in this song.

Gave all of my love but it wasn't enough
Gave all that I had but I'm still not enough
Gave up who I was still wasn't enough
When push comes to shove you always give up

Where did I go wrong? What did I do wrong?
Why can't I move on? Why can't I be strong?

Every day is the same, every days a fucking waste
Every day, I hate everything that I can't change
Every day I awake to the pain in my heart and my brain
Reminding me that you're ok without me and I don't feel the same.
No I don't feel the same, no I won't feel the same, even though I know that you won't change,
I still love you the same cause that's what I'm supposed to do for you, guess I'm just supposed to hurt for you.

I'm sorry you don't know what love is, I'm sorry that you can't see how good you had it, and now I've finally had it, you stabbed me in the back and you laughed as you did it.
Turned me into a joke, a sad boy who talks about hanging himself with a rope,
and you wanted to see me climb the tallest tree and dangle off of it for the world to see, I cannot believe that's how you felt about me,
after everything we've been through
you still can't see how much I hurt over you?
How many nights I lost sleep over you?
How many texts that I sent that just went unread? Replaying those thoughts in my head, alone in my bed, haunted by the shit you said, now I'm seeing red cause I'm a fucking mess and I'm full of stress because I can't eat and I can't sleep and all I think is how I'd rather sink into the earth and be part of the dirt where I can no longer hurt.

This is the last time I'll ever write to you.
This is the last time I'll ever sing for you.
I don't deserve to ever feel like this,
you don't deserve to ever be missed.

## 2020-11-01T22:08:40.000Z - Winter In Hell

As the snow begins to fall

so do my hopes of us ever getting along

cause I just can’t forgive what you’ve done

you were always my favorite song

but now that song is dead and gone

Just like that time when we lost our son

And this all feels so wrong

There were lines you crossed

How do I stay strong

When I feel so lost

All I did was try

All you did was lie

never said goodbye

When you fucked that guy

No I’m not alright

And we’ll never be fine

Guess I’ll see you in anotherlife

you’re as cold as the winter is outside

the blizzard that froze over my life

On paper you’re still my wife

just not anymore in this life

Cause my wife, yea she died, when she put that knife in my back,

buried in the cemetery weather

just like that dream we once had together

Back when you always promised me forever

There never was a happy ever after

Am I getting through to you yet Stevie?

Do you not see all the shit you’ve done to me?

Are you always going to play the victim

when I was never the villain?

All I did was love you, I traded my soul so I could save you,

you always wanted me to fight for you,

all I fucking did was fight for you

And with you and on and on it was all for nothing

All I wanted was for us to have a family,

you knew how much that shit meant to me.

Look what you’re doing to our daughters,

the last thing I want is for them to grow up like their mother.

I know you don’t want to hear what I have to say

but I’m so sick of feeling this way,

I’m so sick of all my thoughts being of your face,

I’m so sick of reliving all of your mistakes.

I’m so sick of losing sleep,

cause I believed all of the promises you made to me.

I never wanted to hate you,

I never wanted to write these songs about you.

But what choice did you give me

## 2020-11-01T22:09:29.000Z - This Keystone Holiday

This year I have nothing under the tree
Except regrets about the times you had with me
Why the fuck did we even get married?
Just so you could cheat and kill me like the son we buried?

All in all I wish you well
Like straight down into hell
Back to where you came from
Back to where you belong

I'm sick of writing all these songs
Sick of staying up all night long
Sick of of feeling so damn lost
Wish our paths had never crossed

(Just stay away from me this year)

Dear santa will you grant me this one wish?

(Cause I hate your face more than anything)

Will you drop your sled right on top of this bitch?

(And this year on the holiday)

I know she's on your naughty list

(I just want you to go away)

From all the awful shit she did

I promise that's all I want this Christmas

(So just stay away)

Please Santa will you grant me this one wish?

(I hate your face)

I hope this year that I get (yeah)
everything I’m wanting
Which is you wrapped up in lights
Plugged in and drowning
I know it won’t be my name that you’re calling
But that’s ok cause down to hell you will be falling

## 2020-11-01T22:09:56.000Z - Phora

Here I go, so damn cold.I'm up late
and nobody hits up my phone,
What a joke, yeah nobody even knows
How hard it is for me to let this go.
I feel I'm losing control
of my emotions I don't wanna show
You use to be my only home
but now you're Just somebody I use to know
Back before you turned into a hoe
But we both know that was a long time ago
You deserve to be the one who's all alone
So please just get that ass up off of that throne

Thinking back was it really so bad?
Nevermind, I already know the answer to that.
It's alright, and I'll be fine,
Cause all you ever did was waste my time,
With all the lies and the shit that you hide,
Those fucking eyes I will forever despise.
That shit ain't right, guess you thought I was blind.
A Pretty face but You're so ugly on the inside,
And I don't care that you're no longer mine,
Cause compared to you,
better things won't be hard to find.
And when you find me on your mind,
And you start to realize that I'm alright,
I hope I haunt you every night.

## 2020-11-01T22:10:14.000Z - 200

I heard you're telling lies about you and I again.
Talking all that shit just to get some attention
Hopping on his dick and calling it affection
I won't say no names cause I don't need to mention

Cause we all know who you are
And we all know what you've done
Guess I need to call you out
And put you in another song

Bitch, I'm so sick of this
I use to be in love with you
But now you make me sick
Get used to it

Bitch I hate this shit
All you are is cancer
And I am finally cured of it
Staying clear of it

You used to be my wife
Back in another life
Back before you chose
To fuck my cousin that April night

I'm done with all your lies
I'm done wasting my time
On a selfish bitch who just
Wants to get drunk every night

I use to wonder how you sleep at night
But Now I know you sleep just fine
As long as someone holds you every night
You go on pretending everything's alright

Liar, liar, liar,
Light yourself on fire

I'm only here to inspire

## 2020-11-01T22:10:48.000Z - Mom II

Growing up you were always there for me
And even now at 33, you're still here for me
I know you're my mom and you're supposed to be
But not everyone has a mom they can call family
You gave me everything during the times I had nothing, gave me a life jacket when I was drowning, showed me life gets better when I didn't believe, helped me get on my feet so my goals I could achieve
And now I can show my own kids how life's supposed to be

I'm sorry I put you through hell when you were just trying to help, I know I let you down more times than I can count, you always gave me love when she only gave me doubt and in the end we see how that played out, I want you to know you're the reason I found myself, the reason I feel whole and not a hollow shell, that peace within when I want to scream and shout and imma sing this song for you out loud and let you know I'm proud to have a mom like you. I love you

## 2020-11-01T22:11:18.000Z - MOUTHBREATHER

Got a text from my ex the other day
Telling me "I won't be shit, I won't be anything
I'm just a loser and that's all I will ever be
My music sucks nobody's even listening"

And at first, yeah that shit hurt.
It put my feelings right down deep in the dirt
but I got to thinking that's not what I deserve,
she already cheated me once,
she won't take my self worth.

I never texted back cause I saved it for this track.
You can kiss my ass while I put you on blast.
You just mad cause you can't control me and that's a fact.
And yeah It's sad you take it out on me for what he lacks.

Oh no, oh no it's all my fault that you hate your life
Oh no, oh no guess it's all my fault that you fucked up your life,
but it ain't my fault that you were such a shitty wife,
Yeah, it ain't my fault that you lied and cheated so many times

Go ahead and keep opening your mouth
All it's good for is sucking that dick anyhow
Go ahead and tell me that nobody's listening now
A couple thousand plays and I ain't even slowing down

One day our girls are gonna hear this shit
And on that day I still won't be ashamed of it
Cause they have every right to know the truth
And we both know they'll never get it from you

Fuck you S. Marie
go ahead and sue my ass for slandering and for slaughtering your image yeah right bitch please
Should have thought twice fore you come at me
Dont make me put you on a billboard it's tempting

## 2020-11-01T22:11:39.000Z - Ever After

Two years ago I lost everything
and I mean everything,
My hopes, my dreams
it all came apart at the seams
Put out on the street like I was nobody like I was nothing.

I lost my wife, my job, my home,
had nothing but my clothes,
Not an ounce of hope,
no direction I could go,
I was all alone,
wanted to put that gun up to my dome
and pull the trigger
Cause nothing was getting better,

till I picked up my guitar
and started writing bars
And with the mic yeah I was going hard
on all these songs about my life,
all these song's about my wife
How she cheated and she lied
About the other guy
I was dead inside
Ripped my heart out of my chest
Each and every time
Nobody should make you
Want to take your own life
And that's when I realized
I'm the only one who gets to decide

So I chose to live
I Got so much to give
I'm gonna show my kids
That I keep my promises

Cause the grass is always green
If that's how you choose to think
And that's what I believe
I put that on everything

I just want my words to matter
To give you hope and laughter
And show you how to get
To that happy ever after
To tell you that you matter
Regardless what they say
Cause you can do better
Let me show you the way

You're not worthless
You are worth it
You're not a loser
Yeah you're fuckin perfect
And I'mma let you know
That You are beautiful
So don't you let go
Cause you're not alone

I found myself, I got some help,
I went through hell and lived to tell
I was just a hollow shell
At least that's how it felt
and though you found somebody else,
I still wish you well
cause I'm a better man than he ever will be
and that's what you deserve for what you did to me, so I just wanna say rest in peace to you and me,
you're no longer my wife, just a memory,
so RIP you're just a Melody in a song that set me free and I'm at peace without you next to me,
I am free and that's the one thing
you will never take from me!

I'm at peace, I am free,
I can finally sleep and I'm living out my dream.

It's all because of you, my dreams came true
All because of what you put me through
Guess I should be thanking you
But I won't cause you still a hoe
and that's the truth you already know

My only purpose here is to inspire you
To give you hope when you're feeling down and blue
To provide that light in your darkness too
Cause I've been where you're at and that's the truth

and how she fucked me over so many times and I won't lie I still struggle with anxiety in my mind, I still fight my depression every night. But I see the light and I see the love for me in my children's eyes and I can't let them down again cause I've been a shitty dad cause they had to deal with the aftermath of me and their mom and that shit ain't right so I'mma hold on tight to the fact that they're my biggest prize and I'mma show them a better life. Where I'm no longer mad, I'm no longer sad, cause these days things aren't so bad and I hold onto what I have and that's a fact.

## 2020-11-01T22:12:02.000Z - I Decide My Own Fate

I wish I could explain, what's going on inside my brain,
That Every thought is filled with pain,
from memories I can't erase
and helplessness that I can't escape
and these feelings never fade,
feels like I'm stuck in place,
even when I try and change,
start over every day,
some shit is hard to face.
I just need to get away,
cause I don't want to stay.
I decide my own fate.

I don't know where to go these days,
All I know is shit don't ever change.
Try to get away before it's too late.
Try to move on cause I just can't stay.

I know it's hard to let go,
When you're feeling so low,
And nobody even knows,
What's killing you the most.

I got to let go of this life,
Cuz you are no longer my wife.
Doesn't matter how I try.
I always fail with time.

I don't know where to go these days,
All I know is shit don't ever change.
Try to get away before it's too late.
Try to move on cause I just can't stay.

and these feelings never fade,
feels like I'm stuck in place,
even when I try and change,
start over every day,
some shit is hard to face.
I just need to get away,
cause I don't want to stay.
I decide my own fate.

## 2020-11-01T22:12:23.000Z - ---

I've lost so many nights of sleep
Due to my depression and anxiety
My own mind playing tricks on me
I can't tell if I'm awake or it's a dream

I'm haunted by my past mistakes
A constant movie that's stuck on replay
And all I want is to get away
But I feel stuck in a rut I can't escape

I write about my life and about what's wrong and right
About the times my heart was broke and I was dead inside
People started to relate and look to me for guidance
I don't have all the answers but I'm someone you can confide in
All I can say is you gotta push through the pain
Wake up every day and paint a smile on your face
Even when you're not ok even when the color turns to gray cause eventually those clouds wil

## 2020-11-01T22:13:04.000Z - Thank You

I just want to thank you for everything you've done for me and I promise I will repay you with all I have, when I'm on my feet.

Yeah it's just begun, my life is finally looking up and I can smile again. Feels like I'm finally alive again. It's been so long, yeah, that I have seen the sun cause my depression held me hostage with a fucking gun. My anxiety, it told me I would never leave and I will never be anything cause that's just what my wife believed and than it hit me, I was right where she wanted me to be.

These last two years have been the fucking hardest.
Didn't think that I would make it this far and
I know that I am grateful, I just want to say that I'm thankful.

I just want to thank you for everything you've done for me and I promise I will repay you with all I have, when I'm on my feet.

## 2020-11-01T22:13:43.000Z - Sad Boi

Call me lost boy, call me sad boy
Call me whatever the fuck you want boy
Truth is, this music shit is my therapy
This is where I go when people abandon me

Most days I try to inspire, but some days
I just want to throw your ass in the fire
For all the hell you put me through
And not just me but our children too
You fucked me up cause I was never enough
You just used and abused me but I never gave up
You're the one who's a fucking coward and a cheat
I gave you all I had but now you won't take shit from me.

There I go again, talking about you like I always do
At least you know I got nothing good to say about you
7 years we had together, we lost our first born forever
Buried him in that tiny coffin on the 5th of September
I held you while you cried every night till December
We could have been buried in the cemetery weather
But you chose to go and every fucking tie you severed

Took me almost two years to start living again
If it wasn't for my kids and this music I'd be dead
And I'm not just saying that for attention
Cause back in August I really tried to end it
I remember laying in that hospital bed all alone
Didn't tell anybody but you and you just hung up the phone
and that's when I finally knew that you
didn't give a fuck if I killed myself over you

So here I am it's been 5 months and I've never felt more at peace, I know you don't hear it in these songs but I've been trying to be forgiving, and understanding and caring about hurting your feelings but I'm not there yet,

So call me lost boy, call me sad boy
Call me everything you hate boy
Truth is because of you I need therapy
And this music shit is what helps me
Cope with the way you abandoned me

## 2020-11-01T22:14:13.000Z - Hate Me

Sitting all alone inside this room and I don't know what I should do, cause I just hate everything I'm around lately.
Wish that I could do the things I used to do, like way back when I never knew you, now all you ever do is hate me

So fucking hate me all that you want
you fucking played me or so you thought
I gave you my heart and all that I got
you just mad cuz you got yourself caught
So fucking hate me all that you want
you fucking played me or so you thought
I gave you my heart and all that I got
you just mad cuz you got yourself caught

## 2020-11-01T22:14:39.000Z - Past Tense

Last year I hit rock bottom
I'm still here but I swear I'm trying to crawl out
Cause this can't be my permanent residence
I know I'm meant for more that's clearly evident

I take my thoughts and I turn them into song's
I try to paint a picture of how my life went wrong
And I try and tell myself that I have to stay strong
And convince myself somehow that I do belong

I write about my life and how I'm not alright
How I felt so dead inside & every night I always cried
As I was laying all alone with nobody at my bedside
And I'd replay all the awful things trapped in my mind

I almost took my life back on that August night
Cause somebody that I loved hurt me for the last time
And to them I was already dead so fuck it, time to end it, I'll crash this fucking car driving off into the sunset

Was it really worth it to make me feel so worthless?
To tell me that you hate me and that I deserve it?
And that he makes you feel better than I ever did
And I'm just a fucking loser and a piece of shit
When all I ever gave was you was everything I had
And all I ever did was everything that you asked
And your thank you was by stabbing me in the back
Comparing me to him and everything that I lack

You ripped out my heart and laughed as I fell apart
And I forgave you so many times but you a poison dart
guess that's my fault for not seeing it from the start
I tried to light your life when all you did was make mine dark

And that's the truth, that's the real you and it makes me so damn sad that I wasted so much time on you
I know I'm not perfect but I sure as fuck ain't worthless
You're the reason I'm a mess, and why I'm always stressed, and I confess these issues I address are just a sign we were never meant but I can't just forget all the shit you said, it plays over every night in my head

And I can't sleep and I can't dream
cause you're the killer following me,
the ghost that's still haunting me,
the lack of oxygen suffocating me
You're the anxiety when I need peace
You're the reason I no longer believe
You're the devil who stole my soul to keep
You're the cause of all this misery

But here's the thing, you're gonna be the reason I succeed, the reason I found someone who makes me happy, the reason I'm a better person than you will ever be and when I'm on your TV screen, you'll finally see that without you I'm living out my dream.

## 2020-11-01T22:15:06.000Z - Just Quit

What's the point? I ask myself, does my music even help?
What if no one's listening, is it really worth all this hell?

I want to inspire others to change their life
but right now I can't even change mine.
I talk about the past like it's present time,
and I'm so sick of that life, so why do I rewind?

I'm just a worthless piece of shit,
a fucking loser that's just full of regret
at least that's what you said and I guess
I heard that for so long Its hard not to believe it

What am I doing with my life?
Besides wasting all my time
On music that nobody even likes
I guess maybe you were right.
Maybe this will be the last song that I ever write,

Is anybody out there? Does anybody care
If I keep writing

## 2020-11-01T22:16:01.000Z - Days Inn

I just want to talk about life
With someone who's down to listen
I just want some good vibes
Cause that's what I've been missin

I just want to pass the time
With someone who really cares
I just want to free my mind
With someone who wants to be here

I just want to let you know
That I know it goes both ways
That together you and I can grow
I want to hear all you have to say

Cause life is way too short to feel so alone
I don't want to build a house I want to build a home

I want to be the reason you smile in every mood
And on the days you fall apart I wanna be the glue
That holds you together when things fall through
That's the truth and all I want is for you to stay true

Just vibe with me and ride with me
Past time with me stay fly with me
Just try with me don't give up on me
Just love with me and grow old with me

You're so beautiful
In every shade of light
And I'm hypnotized
By the way you shine so bright

Just vibe with me and try with me
Live life with me and ride with me
Past time with me feel whole with me
Don't give up on me grow old with me

## 2020-11-01T22:17:25.000Z - Farewell Lover

Dear you know who,
it's no surprise I still write about you,
some days I hate you and some days I forgive you
Other days I dont think about you
And sometimes I'm consumed by you

You're not my obsession anymore
Just a lesson on moving forward
I can't live with hate in my heart
Even though you tore me apart

When they ask me if I'd do it all over again
The answer will always be a yes
Not because of the pain in the end
But because that's just who I am

Maybe I didn't show you how much I cared
The way that you wanted me to.
But I tried my best to always be fair
And I wanted nothing more than to marry you

## 2020-11-01T22:17:56.000Z - I Am a Lighthouse

Damn it's been a bad day
Had a meltdown on the freeway
I couldn't even see straight
I know I shouldn't have even been driving

Cause I turned straight into on coming traffic
I hit a woman head on it could've been tragic
Thank God that she was alright I
cause I would never forgive myself If she died
I know that still doesn't make it right
That I ruined someone else's night
Because of all the shit going through my mind
I lost so much of who I was to my cheating wife
And that's when I knew that I had to change my life
I had to take control and start to put up a fight
And that's the moment when I began to really take flight
And started to see myself as somebody I like

I am more than enough, I'm a diamond in the rough
I've got a big heart and so what if I care too much
I won't apologize for flooding you with love
If you were drowning it's cause you knew you fucked up

And when it came to you,
there was nothing you could do
to make me ever give up on you
we lost a son and even though some plans fell through In the end I still gave you everything I promised you
And what did you do? You found somebody else
Who is just like you and that's the real truth
Guess I finally saw you for the real you

So now I'm gonna be a light house
Cause everywhere I go it's always dark out
And I'm so sick of feeling like I'm gonna drown
When all I'm trying to do is turn my life around
I know that I'm a fucking mess right now
You can hear the pain in my voice as I sing out loud
But I have planted my roots into solid ground
And now I'm going to guide those who are lost back out

I just want my words to matter,
to inspire hope and a little laughter
I want to help you achieve what you've been chasing after and let you know you're not alone cause to me you really matter

Be your own light in somebody else's life
Take all your pain and use it to make things right
Be somebody your children will look up to every night
Always choose to love when others give up and fight the good fight

I am a Lighthouse, guiding the way out now

## 2020-11-01T22:18:46.000Z - A Better Ending

Dear, "you know who" I'm not here to hate on you
So hear me out cause this is my only landline to you
You were my favorite song but I no longer play you
Cause you can't stay in key & I don't wanna autotune

Please I hope you take no offense to that
I ain't hatin cause I am growin past that
Straight ahead, gotta new quest, I ain't looking back
I am pushing forward like I'm a giant thumb tac

All that pain is still up inside my brain
but Ive begun to heal and let some out every day
I found my escape from that mental prison cage
And I can honestly say that I'm gonna be ok

Even though we no longer talk
You still wander in my thoughts
Cause you were more than just a memory
And for so long I let you have the best of me
The way you left put a hole right through me
But I forgive you and I can say that with all honesty
I forgive you, damn I hope you're hearing me
Cause I'm still the man I said I would always be

You were my everything, now you are melody
Use to be in love with me but now I'm a memory
And I was never perfect but for you I tried to be
Guess that's travesty mixed up in the key of irony

I hope that you are doing alright
I can finally say that with a smile
And damn I spent awhile
In all the hallways of denial

I wish you the best, with the same heart you ripped out my chest. I hope you find true happiness, even after you said I was your biggest regret.

You were always my favorite song
But I can't play it anymore it feels wrong
Cause everything will eventually end
And I guess that's the way that it belongs

I finally found a way to let you go
It was In the Cemetery Weather
That we once shared together, you know
Those plans of forever died way back in November
And I wrote A Better Ending
so we both would end up happy

You'll always be more than just a memory
You always meant more than you could ever see
*As We Grow Older *I hope we both move forward
And our hearts don't grow colder as we struggle to stay sober, it's over, it's over, it's over.

I just want to see you smile again.
That's the way our fairy tale ends

## 2020-11-01T22:19:19.000Z - Exhale Depression

This is my chance to get it right
For the first time in my life
I can see all the blue skies
I set my aim for my sights

Long days, long nights
A million ways to fail
But I'mma get it right
Too long I been down
Get me out of this room
Won't feel sorry for myself
Body pains and headaches
Aren't really shit compared
To when a heartbreaks
Breathe in and breathe out
I use to be so lost
When I was filled with doubt

I took all my sadness and depression
And turned it into vocal expression
Added some eq, waves tune and compression
These were my life's biggest lessons
And my most personal confessions

And I write every night, till I get it right
Won't stop till I see an end in sight
I sing for you to help you get through
And I will be your light when you need me to
I promise I am only here to guide you
I will light up your life till I am right beside you

Keep your Head high, when youre feeing low
And Don't let anyone say you ain't beautiful

When that pain starts to ache
and your heart needs a break
From all the people who are fake
When they lying right to your face
Fuck em all, who cares what they say
Cause you a better person even on your worst days
What you're going through is just a phase
And as time goes by you'll begin to erase and replace
All that shit that's been keeping you in place
Keep One foot forward aim for outerspace
Move as slow as you want just finish the race

I'mma be the light that guides you,
I'll be in that car ridng beside you

Turn up the stereo and get that bass bumping low
And start to show the world that you are beautiful

## 2020-11-01T22:20:25.000Z - Vacant

They say that home is where you make it
But lately my only home has been vacant
these thoughts I can't seem to shake them
And these memories I can't replace them

For so long I've been holding on
When I should have been moving on
I'm sorry that it took me so long
But Life ain't been the same now that you're gone

I tried to put the pieces of me and you
Back together like we could be glued
But there's some things you just can't undo
I never wanted to give up on you

These days, I'm not the same
So much of who I am has changed
And sometimes I don't recognize my face
And for that I only have myself to blame

I finally found a way to let you go
And after all of this I hope you know
That it was always you who mattered most
I forgive you and I wish the best for you both

Farewell to our fairy tale, I hope this finds you well
Throughout all our hell, you made my heart melt
won't forget how that felt I'm sorry hope you can tell

This story of you and me is now over for eternity

## 2020-11-01T22:21:13.000Z - 4am

It's four o clock in the morning
and I'm just going crazy in my head
Wondering what am I doing,
Cause I don't even know right now

Oh yeah she's sippin
Oh yeah She's livin
life in the moment
She's not losing sleep over me
I'm nothing more than a memory

I'm not perfect but I tried to be
Doesn't matter I just need some sleep
Physically exhausted mentally haunted
No longer wanted just build me my coffin

It's four o clock in the morning
And Its just me, myself and anxiety
I've become a hostage in my own misery
It's pathetic wish I could just fucking sleeping

## 2020-11-01T22:21:53.000Z - Take Me Back

There's a million things I want to say to you
I don't want to fight, I don't want to hate you
I just want to talk like when we first met
I wish there was a way to remove the resentment

Take me back to November 2011
A few months before I turned 27
The first time I saw you in that yellowcard shirt
Back then I didn't know what it really meant to hurt

You showed me love, you showed me pain
Gave me two daughters and two sons
You showed me hate, you showed me change
Gave me a home

## 2020-11-01T22:22:33.000Z - I Wrote the Book on not Giving a Fuck

I wrote the book on not giving a fuck
Pretty easy when you don't give a fuck
I hope it inspires you
to not give a fuck too

I was always the nice guy
always the last choice guy
Always let's just be friends guy
Till I became the sad guy
Who turned into the bad guy
Now Im the don't even try guy
Who is always pissed off guy

Writing about life
and how its passing me by
While I sit and I whine
Bout shit that didn't go right
Fuckin hate my life
Thought this would pass with time
Just gets worse every night

## 2020-11-01T22:23:30.000Z - Bottoms Up

Bottoms up just don't give a fuck
This time I've had enough
So pour another cup
Cause I'm fuckin done
I'm giving up
Anxiety's been too much

Don't miss me when I'm gone
Just blame me I'm always wrong
It's always all my fault
I've had enough I'm done

Just a waste of space in a life I hate
I Tried but I can't fucking change
Such a fucked up mental state
What a way to meet my fate

running away from the shit in my brain
And I need to escape before I go insane
And I will not stay and feel all of this pain
So Get me out of this place before it is too late

Fucking anything
So I won't stay
Need to get away

## 2020-11-01T22:24:08.000Z - Reject

I should change my name to reject.
I wasted so much time trying to hit the reset,
On the shit I can't forget, that list of regrets,
The times that we have spent, all the words that I have said,
They were useless but they're replaying in my head.
I confess, yeah that my life's a mess, I feel so useless
And I openly admit I find it hard to give a shit,
When every day that I sit alone I just wanna quit,
But I don't do it cause I'm so used to this.
I just keep going in hopes that it's not all pointless.

do I wander in your thoughts or am I really dead and gone?
It's hard to move along when everything just feels so wrong. I feel like I don't belong, I hate all these songs

I've never been this low, time is moving so slow
Depression takes it's toll cause I can't let shit go
You were my only home, got evicted long ago
Got Nothing left to show, no room left to grow I don't even know hate feeling so alone

Is anybody listening or am I talking to myself again?
Man I miss my friends, but I don't deserve them cause I've been a worse friend.
I just want someone to care and to always be there,
Through sickness and in health, even if we poor or we got wealth, through good days and through the worst days in hell.

## 2020-11-01T22:24:28.000Z - Unwind

Hard to breathe, hard to think,
I can't sleep, can't feel a thing
anxiety is killin me
Just let me be, please set me free
From all this pain and all this misery

Here I go yeah I'm alone
Out on my own for way too long
I know that I should try more
But I can't find the strength to say
I think I've lost my way

Just hit the reset
That way you can forget
All the bullshit that was said
Get that shit out of your head
Just stop playing pretend and get the fuck over it
All that bad shit all that sad shit get over it

It's time to forgive, time to forget
Time to move past all that bullshit
It's time to move on time to get on
time to get right with your life
yeah that's alright

Oh no I've been unwinding
Oh no I'm out on my grind and
Oh no I just pass the time and
I know, I know I'm all alone
And I'm ok with that

## 2020-11-01T22:24:41.000Z - These Days

These days not much has changed
Old habits die hard I'm still the same
Alone in my room, filled up with gloom
Trying not to think about you

Will it always be this way?
Doesn't matter what I say
Feelings will fade, memories they stay
Even after you get replaced

And though I try my best to change
I always end up in this place
And I don't want to feel this way
It's getting harder to escape

The feelings of regret.
the sadness that I get,
From the way that you left,
it still replays in my head.

Why can't I just forget you?
Why won't my mind erase you?

Give me back my life
Take me back in time
When we met that night
And I promise I'll walk on by

## 2020-11-01T22:25:13.000Z - Cave In

This will be the last you hear from me
Cause this depression finally caving in on me
And I'm starting to sink cause all I do is over think
Until anxiety gets the best of me and I can't breathe

Nothing is getting better only worse
And I'm so sorry to everybody that I hurt
I know I'm a disappointment a fucking failure
All I do is let you down cause nothing ever matters

I'm so stuck in this way that I don't give a fuck
I've had enough shits just too much and I'm like fuck
Fuck this, fuck life, fuck everybody who's ever hurt me

## 2020-11-01T22:26:33.000Z - Fuck

This might be the last time I write
Fuck this music fuck this life
I'm so fucking angry all the time
And that's not how I wanna live my life

How am I supposed to be the light if I can't see it?
How am I supposed to to move forward like this?
How am I supposed to be happy if I don't know how?
How am I supposed to smile when I can't right now?

Thought that if I wrote these songs I would heal
But now I see it's just like me and going nowhere

## 2020-11-01T22:27:10.000Z - Bridge

Hey I know right now you're feeling sad
But everything is dark when you're looking in the past
There's a reason why some things don't last
Please Don't let those thing hold you back

What doesn't kill you makes you still alive
And when things get hard you can't just run and hide
You can't just let it eat you up on the inside
Or it will consume you and your life will pass on by

Keep your head up cause you are enough

## 2020-11-01T22:28:35.000Z - Ok

I'm not really sure how to start this conversation or what the right words are to put it the best way possible so I guess I'm just gonna be blunt and up front.
I know you hate the situation you're in and you're crawling out of your skin, but I'm completely useless and helpless to you right now if things were to go south at the moment.
I understand, you need him to help
Get the kids off the bus and for bills and shit, I know that you hate how and where you've ended up and I understand that you have to fake it until you figure out the best way to go about the situation.
I also know there's no way of faking it and continuing to get him to help you without giving him what he wants from you. Your google photos from the stevielong account is still linked to my google photos account and today i went through the last two years of your life with him and with me and you know what I noticed right away? That when you are with him you never once smiled or lit up the camera the way you did when you were with me. Even through all the kate nights and fights, i know you care and love me.

I don't want you to worry about me, I'm gonna be fine, I need to stay focused on getting out of here and getting my license.
