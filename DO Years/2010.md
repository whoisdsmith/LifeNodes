It seems there are a lot of things wrong with me. Mainly with my head. I can't seem to think for more than 5 seconds.. Its like I have a writers block except its for everythhing...so more like a thinking block...everyday I wake up hoping the next day is going to be better than the last but it never happens. Spmedays I wake up as someone else a person who cares and who gives a shit. Somedays I wake up and am numb to all that surrounds me. And somedays I just want to see the world burn. I don't know how I got this way I guess I've always been like this its just never gotten this severe....I can't seem to finish anything and I seem to be lying more and more for no reason.. I feel like an alien. I can't seem to communicate with anyone anymore. I think maybe I died a long time ago and this is my own hell...I still live in the past and am unable to get out of it. I see becca and want what I will never have...will it always be this way? Why must I torture myself? Why can I just let the door of opportunity open for me? Maybe that door simply does not exist. I am so selfish because there is soo much good in my life. This brain just won't let me see it or feel it.

Hey sorry that you and the boys are sick, hope you all get to feeling better soon...I dont understand the text you sent tonight? I really dont think you have been mean or rude to me...I think youre doing the best you can with everything...I dunno if you still hold a grudge against me for the whole court thing and shit that I did when we broke up...I guess you you wont ever know what I was going through so you cant understand, but I am sorry for all of that... it took me a long time to grow up and hell im still not all the way...but im trying everyday to be a better person and to let go...Im glad you are happy and have everything you ever wanted..I wish there was a way it couldve been with me, but maybe in another life I will get it right...Im not going to make a big deal about you moving, im gonna be extremely sad but im not going to go to the courts or write blogs or whatever...I feel this last year weve grown closer friendship wise and I always have a tendency to screw it up with the things I say and I never mean to offend you...you are a wonderful mom im glad I had a child with a responsible mother...I can promise you I wont have anymore kids because I just cant seem to find that person that made me feel like you did...and even on our worst day its better then most of the good ones I have anymore...but whatever i know you dont want to hear about it...its just one of those nights it will pass...goodnight

Hey, I am sorry for the way I acted on Sunday. I love our son more than anything and I guess I was feeling he was better off without me. I have felt like such a loser because I have no job or life...Everything in my life seems to fall apart and I just get tired of living most days...thank God I have E during this time of my life...I have no idea what im gonna do when he leaves but I made the decision to leave this town and this state...Everything I love will be gone and I need to try and put myself together somewhere new and some place no one knows me...This past year you and I grew up into our friendship and even tho I am just Everetts dad to you, you have always been much more than that to me. God knows its been forever since we have been together but maybe it will take just as long to get over this as when we were together...I am telling you this because I dont know what the future holds for myself, Im trying to get a job on an oil rig or something very physical where I can work tons of hours and make lots of of money for Everett...I didn't mean to make a big deal at lance and chels wedding, but it may have been the last time I got to see you and spend time with you again....and the wedding made me very sad cause I always thought it was going to be you and I...I know you dont understand any of this because you have a new family...my point is whatever happens in the future I want you to know you gave me the best thing in life and that is Everett..but you will always be much more than his Mother to me..I never got a chance to turn my life around when we were together but if I could go back I wouldve set things right..and whatever happens after this life, I hope youre in my heaven or in my next life and maybe i can get it right then..I hope everything works out for you, but if it doesnt ill be some where in this world hoping to rescue you. I dont care if this makes you weird or uncomfortable..I have never been good at saying how I feel, I was never good at showing you how I feel..but it makes me feel better to tell you this because at least I said what I wanted to say instead of holding it all in. I know you wont respond to this and that's for the best because I can make up your reply in my head as something good rather than words I dont wanna hear. I wouldve rather had said all this to your face but I knew id only be wasting your time...you can call E as much as you like and ill keep sending you pics, and if you ever need anything im here night and day, there's nothing I wouldn't do for You or E..
Take Care

The world I want to leave behind
My name is Dustin Smith. I was born on the first day of spring in March of 85'. I prefer the few people I have left in my life to call me "D. Smith". Kristin Ruffner gave me that nickname and I love it. I hate the way my body shakes from the cancerous cells that I ingest myself with daily. My head is in a million places, but never where I want it to be. I don't know if that's from being ADHD or having spent the last year dealing with certain tragedies. I blame myself for the continuous downward spiral I am living. Most days I lack the will to better my life, once you start living in despair, regret and in the past, well reality and things like hope and optimism kind of deteriorate. Least that's what is happening to me.
I have an amazing son Everett, he is the reason I haven't leaped off tall buildings or set myself on fire. He is proof that something good can come from these bones. He is my blessing and my curse. He brings out the best in me, but lately I see so much of myself in him that I become solemn and empty because the last thing I want is for him to grow up like me. It sounds sad to say but its the truth.
I have made poor decisions my whole life. I can never seem to finish or follow through on anything. I have lost the will to be motivated in anything. These last three years I have been crushed and crushed again. Each time I scraped my broken body off the floor and attempted to start over and over again. I guess there is a point when giving up just feels better than trying and failing again. Lately I have been living like a recluse because people don't understand what I'm going through and really nobody cares. I use to be that guy who had no problems meeting people and making new friends, but these days I prefer to keep to myself. I prefer the taste of cold beer and the music of nostalgia to keep me company. Most of my friends were not really my friends anyways.
Maybe it is just me, maybe my cold heart cannot see the goodness in others anymore. I will blame myself. This weight of past mistakes I carry will one day crush me I am sure, but until then I will get by on as little as possible. I have less than 5 weeks with my son until he moves to Washington State with his mom and step dad for the next four to who knows how many years. I am doing my best to make the best of this little time I have with him. I am suppose to see him every other Christmas and 6 weeks every summer, but a big part of me thinks this may be the last time we will be together. It is extremely depressing and sad to think that way, but at this time In my life Everett is the bridge that gets me from this place to the next, the parachute that keeps me from falling, the life jacket that keeps me from drowning, he is my life support. When he moves I fear the bridges will collapse, the parachute won't deploy, the life jacket won't stay afloat and the plug will be pulled.
I use to believe in hope, in destiny, in life and in love but now I believe in facts and in truth and the truth is we all die and we all end up alone. I was once a good person, but now I am nothing more than a martyr, a lost vessel. I have become a selfish person who cannot recognize the sight of something good. I guess this is who I am now. Maybe I can one day find redemption, who knows.
In 5 weeks if I have not engulfed myself in flames, thrown myself from a tall building or done some selfish act of stupidity, I plan on moving and fInding a good paying job that involves endless hours and physical work. I guess it doesn't matter where I go cause there's nothing keeping me here anymore. Everyone has their own life and I don't seem to fit into them anymore.
It is the 4th of July today and its one of those days where i really hate certain people, maybe most people. Everyone is always bitching about their fucking relationships. Just shut the fuck up and enjoy what you have because not all of us are so lucky to have someone that loves you back. I guess that i am too disconnected from human conversation to ever have a decent relationship with anyone. I spent almost the last 9 months in a fucking mental craze. I spent almost all of January and February in drug induced comas, swallowing red pills of death almost everyday to make me feel happy. I swear I should be dead or that my stomach should not be in tact. Maybe I am dead and I still go through my day to day routines in a state of purgatory. Why I wasn't cast straight to hell is a mystery. I have nothing good to prove to myself or to anyone else for that matter.
I am broken beyond repair and there is no cure for this madness. I may as well be stuck on this planet all alone.
If something should happen to me along the way there are a few things I want to say to those who mean the most to me.
Everett.
you are the most precious and beautiful human being in this world. I love you more than these words could even attempt to explain. I hope you grow ...

Part I
I can't believe it's been a year since I let that fuckin family destroy my spirit and push me into a full blown relapse. After all the shit i did for her, I gave every piece of myself to that relationship and I never asked for anything in return. Four months in a hospital is enough to drive anyone crazy, my intentions were good all I wanted was for us to be happy, but like everything else it comes with a price. I could never have married into a family that feeds off of other peoples humility. How could a parent feed lies to their own child and live with themselves? Fuckin told her I only wanted to marry her because of the insurance money and that I was just using her. I lost my job and my house and moved into the hospital so I could help take care of her, Money never once crossed my mind, I've never taken a hand me down in my life, I have worked hard for the things that I have and I ended up selling Everything I own just to be able to eat and be with her. Every time I tell this story it just sounds more unbelievable. What kind of parent would humiliate their daughters boyfriend because he asked her to marry her? It was a situation in which most would have walked away, but I didn't, I stayed and tried to give her the strength to overcome this tragedy, but they were jealous because she would only respond to me after coming out of that coma. God damn if my kid was ever in this situation and he had someone who wanted to be there with him no matter what, I would be so grateful not jealous. But it was a situation that grew into stress and hate, you can only take being treated like shit for so long until the day comes and you lose it. After weeks of being humiliated and called a piece of shit, I started to believe it. I can't tell you how many nights I locked myself in my room and shut the world out because I felt so unworthy. I drank every night just to fall asleep, i took pill after pill to stay high enough to not give a shit hell I even wrote my own eulogy just in case I accidentally overdosed, but how do you accidentally overdose? I think Brett is the only one who knew of this, but now I will tell the world cause I'm climbing out of this abyss. I'll never let anyone break me down like that again. Im starting to get back on me feet again, I can't believe it's taken me over a year, but I'm so thankful my body never gave up on me, I never want to go through this shit again. I'm done this is it. I no longer drink to get you out of my head, I drink because I'm starting to live again, I can finally walk into a room and look another human being in the eyes without feeling I'm not good enough for anyone or anything because I know I am, I am the shit, who else could have came out of this alive? Thank you to my mother who has never let me down even when I have been such a selfish person, thanks to all my family and friends for being there through my ups and downs, and to my son, daddys gonna make you proud. I love and miss you kiddo

And to my son, I love you more then these words could ever explain, I'm sorry that I have neglected you so much during this period of my life, I never wanted you to see me like that
