## 2011-04-07T09:34:00.000Z - Failure of Time Invention-The Night They Found Me On The Bathroom Floor

I'm staring at these pills in front of me and I cant stop my hands from shaking
I wonder what it takes to get to you, will you notice when I am not here?
Will you pretend like I was never alive, or will you finally open your eyes
to see the world that you left behind while you were out chasing the other guy?
Here me out just one last time, I never meant for things to go this far
but your words left me paralyzed as you walked out that door
you make this seem like its easy, you make me feel like I am nothing
I tried my best but my best was never good enough for you my darling
I'm staring at the mirror in front of me and I can't stop what I have done
I am sorry for the pain this will cause if I don't make it through the night
Tell my son I love him, tell my Mom I'm sorry, give my love to the family
be strong without me, hold on to the good things that we have shared
This was just a one shot demo i recorded all on my laptop, its about an event that took place about five years ago, when my ex called just to tell me I never made her happy and that she finally found what happiness is...Long story short I overdosed on Vicodin, Vodka, and Coricidin and was found passed out on the bathroom floor...Luckily I survived but Ill never forget how terrible people can make you feel...this is a reminder

The Failure of Time Invention-An Unkindness of Ravens
This is the intro to the new record, I used holdens speech from the movie "Chasing Amy" because I found it very fitting with how the rest of this record plays out.
Why are we stopping?
Cause I can't take this.
I love you.
Can't take what?
You love me?
I love you. And not, not in a friendly way, although I think we're great friends. And not in a misplaced affection, puppy-dog way, although I'm sure that's what you'll call it. I love you. Very, very simple, very truly. You are the-the epitome of everything I have ever looked for in another human being. And I know that you think of me as just a friend, and crossing that line is-is-is the furthest thing from an option you would ever consider. But I had to say it. I just, I can't take this anymore. I can't stand next to you without wanting to hold you. I can't-I can't look into your eyes without feeling that-that longing you only read about in trashy romance novels. I can't talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are. And I know this will probably queer our friendship - no pun intended - but I had to say it, 'cause I've never felt this way before, and I-I don't care. I like who I am because of it. And if bringing this to light means we can't hang out anymore, then that hurts me. But God, I just, I couldn't allow another day to go by without just getting it out there, regardless of the outcome, which by the look on your face is to be the inevitable shoot-down.

I'm gonna try and have the new version of your song for you to take home tomorrow, I have to finish vocals on the second half of the song today, it's 6 minutes long because I added a new part for the ending. I believe it's my best lyrics yet, you know that all my songs are the stories I tell about my life and I don't think I've ever been as honest and as heartfelt as I am in this song.
I've been trying to make you a record for the last 3 years, now I'm writing one with you in it. Because no matter where we go in life you're always going to be a part of me. If you end up getting married I better be a damn bridesmaid or something haha I will smother you and bother you as much as I can because I have a lot of days to catch up on having you as my friend. I say I'm sorry cause I mean it, and although I'm trying to stay out of that time period of my life with Emily and I know you dont want to relive that time period but i never told you my side of the story. You need to understand that I was living in a fairytale. I shut you out because (and as fucked up as this is going to sound) I needed someone who I knew could hurt me, and I knew how you felt about me, I knew how much you've been hurt and that you would never have done those awful things to me. It's not that I didn't want to be with you, you were always good enough but I always pictured my life with you as being safe and maybe even perfect and I have no clue why I thought that was such a bad thing back then. I was so fucked up that its like I was looking to be hurt because that's all I've known... After I ended it with Emily, I was at an all time low because of her and her family driving my self worth into the ground. You and I were together a few times before you got with mike and once you told me you were pregnant I bailed on you again. Once again not your fault, I really wish I had been there for you when Scarlet was born but that time period of my life was so dark. I wish I would have stayed close with you because I know we could have helped each-other out, I know if I had been able to come and talk to you about what I was going through you would have saved me from a lot of empty nights. I don't want to relive the past anymore I just feel i owe you an explanation for everything and an apology. Hope this helps in some way cause I am never good at saying how I feel or owning up to my mistakes. Love you Bff

## 2011-05-06T21:53:07.348Z - Kristin 2

My head was a mess back then, I couldn't see the truth, that you were always there for me whenever I needed you. I can't explain what happened, I'm still learning to be human, I'm still trying to say I'm sorry for the nights you stayed up crying. If I could change one thing, itd be my 24th bday, when you gave me that picture frame and I pretended it meant nothing. I detached myself from you, said it was for the best cause I met someone new and I threw away our lives for someone I barely knew and I've spent these last few years questioning the truth. The truth is sometimes painful and we have both felt that role, of caring for someone who thought it was better to let them go. Now I realize you were that one piece I couldn't make fit cause I never took the time to open my eyes and see the bigger picture, that life is a puzzle we put together and it's canvas is sometimes dark and the scene can paint nightmares of your world being torn apart. You are the glue that held me together

I once had a family and built a castle out of hope and love, but when they left I collapsed along with everything I worked so hard to build.

Reasons why I will probably always be single. I don't like rules or being told what to do, I love my son and music and they both come first, when I want to hangout with my friends I'm going to, I do what I want. I don't wait in line for no girl, if you're too hot then you're too much trouble. If I like you I'll treat you good if I don't like you it's cause you're a stage 5 clinger and you're scaring me. The end

The day after Green.
I spent these last 6 months locked inside my room, taking pills to kill all the thoughts of me and you. I was just wasting my life, got pretty good at almost dying.
Left a note for friends and family that read "I'm sorry please forgive me, it was an accident"
but that was an excuse to not make me feel like such a coward, cause every time I took those pills I thought of you, I hoped and prayed they would take me back in time, so I could show you that you meant everything.
But the sun would always rise and I'd wake up in a bed full of sweat, cold and alone.
On repeat day after day until st patties when I chased the white down with the blue, and tried to drink enough to forget you....and it all went black and I realized where I was at.
I saw my friends all in front of me and a son with out his daddy, saw my mom all alone crying as they buried me. I smelled the perfume of a girl that I once knew, remembered how much she loved me. There were flowers on my grave and I heard my father say "why did you leave us this way" I tried to tell him I was sorry but the words just came out blurry
and all the sudden I wake up and it's 730 Friday morning, I peeled my face off the kitchen floor, tried to figure out if I was dead or dreaming and then it hit me that I was alive and this might be the only chance I get to set things right.
I've been clean ever since and I'll never go back to that mess again.

Leave
Leave me to myself, let me drown in all of my self doubts. I can't stand who I am anymore, it gets harder to pick myself up off the floor. I wonder if you ever wonder about me, my head is filled up of you and too many memories. I can't stand the sun cause I always feel like I'm not good enough.
All I can say is that I'm sorry, but in this current state I'm just not healthy and my body feeds off of negativity and consumes all the good left inside of me
Leave me all alone, close the door and just go home. I will carry on this tune of self pity, as I swallow down the liquid poison with candy. I often wonder what would happen if I died, I know I told you on the phone that I was fine, but I lied. If you could only hear me now, would you try and make it better somehow?
I need help, but I need to figure this mess out myself. I need you, but you can't see past all the hell that we've been through. I need hope, but what's the point with a heart that's grown so cold. I need truth, so that in time I can start to be honest with you
6:07 PM
Time: It can heal wounds and broken hearts, it will lead you to forgiveness or bitterness, it will show you the cracks in your skin, it can make you forget who you are, but somehow Time will never let you forget the person you loved the most, you may be happy and moved on to someone new, but if you happen to run across that old love, I bet you Time will stand still and your heart sinks to your stomach.

6 yrs ago today, I sat in the hospital with Rebecca Rodriguez impatiently waiting for the arrival of our son Everett Tyler Lee, its crazy how different our lives are now, he has grown up so much, but we have too and not just in parenting but as friends. You gave me the best thing life has to offer & in my growing up I have learned to be grateful for that. So cheers to us for raising such a handsome and wonderful boy!

I hate smoking but I find it sexy when cute girls smoke. I don't know why either

I just reminded myself that alcohol isn't a solution, music is because I always do my best work when Im at my worst.

## 2011-07-27T01:22:00.000Z - This Day Was Meant for Us

This day was meant for us
I never thought that we would give up
If I could do things over
I'd find a way to save our love
I learned that time heals the pain, but time can't erase those old feelings
And when I see your face, my heart weakens and I can't breathe
Straight to my stomach it drops
once again Im starting to get lost
In that place where we still exist
As two lovers who wanted kids

Reality sets in, my mind is caving in and Im confused again, I break before I bend. Will I ever end this fiction in my head? I need to try and live a life that you're not in.
Wake up

Straight to the bottom I fall, with a body full from the alcohol.
I will always dive right in, before I know how deep of shit I'm in
A poor excuse to
Verse 2
and when that day comes around where our eyes meet again, you'll know.
that if I can't be with you, well then
I'd rather be alone

Straight into darkness I go, a lonely road where nobody follows
This path I walk alone in hopes to find my way back home

This tables set for one
An empty seat where you once was
A reminder to move on
And let go of what went wrong

Intro version

Th

Family of 2 will soon be 3
And then I see your face
my knees go weak and I might faint
To hold our little
And
Straight to the floor they drop
These tears of joy we cried a lot
In a place where new life begins
On a day that we'll never forget

And then
I see your pretty face, I've loved since the 10th grade and I can't look away cause you still mean everything. I told you we'd be fine and we could start a life where the sun will always shine and our kids can play outside
So sleep well

Seems like yesterday we first met
Can't believe we just had a kid
I love you more with every breath
I will love you until my death
Are you proud of where were at?
Am I still your heart attack?
Please Tell me I'm not dreaming
Cause if I am don't wake me up

Driving away is the hardest part, watching what you love the most getting smaller in the rearview mirror. I'm gonna miss my son, I'm gonna miss the way his mom and I finally became friends. I know this isn't goodbye, it's I'll see you later, its ill call you soon, it's I promise to do my best without you here. I love you in every way shape or form possible.

Dear son, I know it's only been 3 days since you got in that van and drove away. I can't help that I miss you already, Michigan just isn't the same.

Please know that I'm doing my best and I will call as often as I can. I hope you like the new state you're in, I can't wait till I see you again

Hey Georgia, If you're listening please shine bright for my baby and hey B, if your ears are open, please tell E that I love him

Dear son, I know you're growing up so fast, Just stay this little until you come back. I think about you every minute of the day without you this house isn't the same.

School starts in just a few weeks, please listen to your mom while she's trying to teach. I hear 1st grade is a lot of fun, enjoy these moments before they are gone.

Hey Georgia, If you're listening please shine bright for my baby. And lately I'm counting the days till you're here for the holidays

I know that this isn't fair but that doesn't mean that I don't care and hey B, if your ears are open, please tell E that I love him

She said "I'm so sorry, please don't hate me" and I knew that she meant it cause she knows what it's like without him. I replied "it's fine and I don't hate you, I forgive you" and I meant it cause I know what it's like to be in love

As I waved goodbye, tears became oceans, and I knew that I was human. There is no greater love than the one for my son and there is no greater loss then watching him drive off, into the future without me. I am left behind
struggling hard to find who I am with you. Everything I do has all been cause of you, son you are the best thing to happen to me. I am proud of who you are. I hope you know you make proud. I hope I told you I loved you enough, but what is enough when I could never run out of love for you.

Hey Everett, turn your speakers up and sing along.

8/8/11

I am new at this blog stuff, I'm going to try and use this as a new kind of therapy for myself. I read a few blogs that inspired me to try and describe my thoughts. I guess I will start with an introduction..

Part I

I am Dustin Smith. My best friend Kristin started calling me D. Smith about 3 years ago and it has stuck ever since. I am the only child of my mother and my adoptive father, I have 2 sisters and 3 brothers from my seed donor. I don't talk to any of them except my brother James, he's in the army and stationed in iraq, thanks to Facebook we've gotten close the past year or two, other than that I haven't seen him in 20 years.

I have a 6 yr old son Everett Tyler Lee Smith. He is by far the best thing that ever happened to me, it's easy to talk about him but hard not to get emotional over it. He lives in Fort Benning, GA with his mom, little brother and step dad. I have missed out on more of his life than I have been in it. The first few years were due to neglect cause I thought I could become the next big thing at my job. I worked so much that I don't remember his entire first year. It never even bothered me back then. Looking back now I can't help but to beat myself up over it. A job is just a job no matter what it is or how much you make, it should never be more important than your family or the people you love. I hope one day we can be together more than just the summer and a few holidays.. I hope one day I can forgive myself for the things I've done, but I swear that little boy means everything to me and without him here I always end up lost.

I have been in 3 serious relationships since I was sixteen. One of them was for 3 months, the other was 6 weeks, and my first one was for almost 7 years. That was with my sons mom. She showed me a love I have yet to find from anyone else, not because I haven't tried but because that kind of love takes years to get. She is truly a wonderful woman and two years ago I wouldn't be caught dead giving her a compliment. We have been through hell together but during that hell we learned how to grow and to forgive. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever love someone as much as I did her. It's been 4 years this august since she left me for the man who is now her husband. They had a son together 2 1/2 years ago and Everett loves him to death. It took me almost the entire four years to let go and accept that the past is the past and we can't go back. I think she goes mostly by Rebecca now but she will always be Becca to me. She showed me how to really care about another human being, it was a hard lesson to learn cause I had to watch her fall out of love with me and fall into it with someone else, but in the end I realized all of my flaws and the things I needed to change if I am ever to have a lasting relationship again. I am happy she is happy, I know for a long time she wished she could forget me but I hope now when she looks back she smiles and I hope she never forgets those teenage years we spent together. In the last few months we started being friends, in the past we were either lovers or haters towards each other, we never developed a friendship. I am thankful that we can talk as friends now. Between her and my son I could write pages and pages because they were and are the biggest parts of my life.

I use to think things couldn't get worse than losing your first pet. I use to think there was nothing worse than being humiliated in front of the whole school back in 4th grade. I use to think there was nothing worse than having a face full of pimples. I use to think there was nothing worse than my first gf breaking up because I wasn't cool enough. I use to think there was nothing worse than having to shower with everyone else after gym class. I use to think there was nothing worse than my gf breaking up with me to sleep with some douche bag who didn't care about her. I use to think there was nothing worse than hearing the words "im pregnant" while being in the recording studio finishing up final touches for our first record deal. I use to think there was nothing worse than being on tour with two of my best friends, when my fiancÃ© was having complications with my son. I use to think there was nothing worse than working 90 hr weeks and coming home to someone who always complained about me not being around. I use to think there was nothing worse than my fiancÃ© sleeping with someone who was supposed to be a friend. I use to think it couldn't get worse that that. Truth is it can always get worse but hearing the person you have loved so much and for so long tell you that she's pregnant and marrying another man and on top of that taking our son with her as they start a new family, well I don't know if there is anything worse than that but I do know it's been 4 years and Nothings come close to touching those feelings.

This house is empty and so am I.

Regrets haunt me, they eat through these bones and into my soul

I watched you grow up through pictures and phone lines.

If I could go back I would change everything, I didn't know my job would tear us apart, I didn't know how much I neglected you. A lesson I had to learn too late, by the time I realized what I had done you were gone.

The hardest lessons we learn too late.
My chest is empty without you with me

I hope I told you that "I love you" enough

## 2011-09-04T01:34:39.476Z - This House is Empty

This house is empty and so am I.

Regrets haunt me, they eat through these bones and into my soul

I watched you grow up through pictures and phone lines.

If I could go back I would change everything, I didn't know my job would tear us apart, I didn't know how much I neglected you. A lesson I had to learn too late, by the time I realized what I had done you were gone.

The hardest lessons we learn too late.
My chest is empty without you with me

I hope I told you that "I love you" enough

I wrote all these feelings down and tried to tell you how I felt but the words got all mixed up and my temper lost control

## 2011-09-05T01:32:37.056Z - Looking Back, Falling

I was living in the hopes that you would stay
I never knew you were dying just to get away
I spent those last few months
Staying up at night
You had already moved on before you said goodbye
Which meant
No more i Iove yous, no more goodnights
No more "how was your day" and "are you alright?"
No more fighting, no more lying, no more reasons to continue trying
Now that this is over can somebody show me how to move forward

I fell apart while you fell in love
I tried to hate you cause I wasn't enough

Life can be super hard, it can be completely miserable at times but no one is ever truly alone in this world. Remember that you have a choice in life and death, and if you choose death how will you ever see that this pain youre going through now is just a ladder to finding happiness? We all go through pain and darkness, you can kill yourself and be done but know that those you leave behind are the ones who really have to suffer. Talk to somebody.

## 2011-09-17T01:35:28.554Z - Leaving

I woke up to the sun on my face, just a punk ass kid that found my place inside heart that I had to always chase. Just one of the many memories time can't erase. I can still remember the way youd always say, Don't leave me just stay in this bed all day. And like a gentleman I'd always stay

Do you remember that night in December? It was the first Thursday after November.
I can still see myself standing outside
in the rain that turned everything into ice
and I never knew someone could be so cold, that even hell couldn't melt their soul
You left me stranded just so you could escape, and never even told me till it was too late

The way you left me with nothing
Took everything till I was empty

We Live in a World where Everything is Competition and Everyone Wants Something Better, the only way to Stay Who Your with and where Your at is to not Get Comfortable, the Minute You Stop Showing You Care is the Moment They Have Found Someone Else Who Will Remind Them.

Dear son, I know it's only been 3 days since you got in that van and drove away. I can't help that I miss you already, Michigan just isn't the same.

Please know that I'm doing my bestI hope you call me as often as you can. How do you like the new state you're in? I can't wait till I see you again

Hey Georgia, If you're listening please shine bright for my baby and hey B, if your ears are open, please tell E that I love him

Dear son, it's been about three months now, since I hugged you goodbye and you left this town, all I do is think about you and notice how this house just isn't the same.

Don't ever think that I just don't care, even though we hardly speak and I'm not there, my love for you will never change I'm so proud of who you've become

Dear son, I know you're growing up so fast, Just stay this little until you come back. I think about you every minute of the day without you this house isn't the same.

School starts in just a few weeks, please listen to your mom while she's trying to teach. I hear 1st grade is a lot of fun, enjoy these moments before they are gone.

Hey Georgia, If you're listening please shine bright for my baby. And lately I'm counting the days till you're here for the holidays

I know that this isn't fair but that doesn't mean that I don't care and hey B, if your ears are open, please tell E that I love him

She said "I'm so sorry, please don't hate me" and I knew that she meant it cause she knows what it's like without him. I replied "it's fine and I don't hate you, I forgive you" and I meant it cause I know what it's like to be in love

As I waved goodbye, tears became oceans, and I knew that I was human. There is no greater love than the one for my son and there is no greater loss then watching him drive off, into the future without me. I am left behindstruggling hard to find who I am with you. Everything I do has all been cause of you, son you are the best thing to happen to me. I am proud of who you are. I hope you know you make proud. I hope I told you I loved you enough, but what is enough when I could never run out of love for you.

Hey Everett, turn your speakers up and sing along. As I tell the world this is your song.

Well let me explain how we ended up this way. It's such a long and complicated story between your mom and me.So I'll just start from my favorite part 10 years ago on Halloween when we first met at the B.EWe spent 4 years together before you

So son when you grow up and you find someone to that you love and she loves you back, don't ever let her go, don't tale for granted the good things you have

Well let me explain, how we ended up this wayits such a complicated story between your mom and meSo ill start from my favorite part 10 years ago on halloweenit was the night we first met, at a show down her road at the B. Eyou see she was the most beautiful thing that Ive ever seenand back then we were both so happybut as we grew up, we both grew apartI spent all my time away and all my money on mewhile she stayed at home wishing she could just leave

We fell in love but we were both young and we did some things wronging

She said "I'm so sorry one day I hope that you'll forgive me"

In July of 2005 you became a part of our lives

I can still remember that night and the look in your mothers eyes

Bright and alive, blue and teary eyed, she cried and so did I. So did I

I know that this isn't fair but that doesn't mean that I don't care and hey B, if your ears are open, please tell E that I love him

She said "I'm so sorry, please don't hate me" and I knew that she meant it cause she knows what it's like without him. I replied "it's fine and I don't hate you, I forgive you" and I meant it cause I know what it's like to be in love

As I waved goodbye, tears became oceans, and I knew that I was human. There is no greater love than the one for my son and there is no greater loss then watching him drive off, into the future without me. I am left behind
struggling hard to find who I am with you. Everything I do has all been cause of you, son you are the best thing to happen to me. I am proud of who you are. I hope you know you make proud. I hope I told you I loved you enough, but what is enough when I could never run out of love for you.

Hey Everett, turn your speakers up and sing along. As I tell the world this is your song.

Well let me explain how we ended up this way. It's such a long and complicated story between your mom and me.
So I'll just start from my favorite part 10 years ago on Halloween when we first met at the B.E
We spent 4 years together before you

So son when you grow up and you find someone to that you love and she loves you back, don't ever let her go, don't tale for granted the good things you have

Well let me explain,
how we ended up this way
its such a complicated story
between your mom and me

So ill start from my favorite part
10 years ago on halloween
it was the night we first met,
at a show down her road at the B. E
Back then, she was so beautiful to me
We were young, we were dumb
We were reckless and care free

I was in a band with my 2 best friends
We made our way across the country
Playing show after show
While your mom was at home all alone
I wanted to be selfish
when all she wanted was my attention
And than all of a sudden
I got the call that she was pregnant

I wanted to play in band with
My 2 best friends
but as we grew up, we both grew apart
I spent all my time away and all my money on me
while she stayed at home wishing she could just leave

We fell in love but we were both young and we did some things wrong

She said "I'm so sorry one day I hope that you'll forgive me"

In July of 2005 you became a part of our lives

I can still remember that night and the look in your mothers eyes

Bright and alive, blue and teary eyed, she cried and so did I. So did I
