## 2016-01-02T16:14:00.000Z - Day You Wake up is a Chance to Make Things Right, to Say the Things You Mean and to Let Things Go. Happiness is a Choice not a Destination. There Might not Be a Tomorrow for You or for Someone You Care About, Don't Let Your Busy Life Get in the way of what Really Matters, Be Thankful for what You Have and Make Your Amends while You're Still Here. That is All

I don't understand myself at all. Why do I go through these phases over and over? I've been in that phase to be a hard worker and get shit done, been getting less sleep and having more energy.
180 more days until baby #4 is here. I know I don't show it but Stevie and the kids are the only reason I'm still here. They are my world, al I want is to be better for them.

I always thought that I was meant to do something big something great, I've always thought that maybe I could change the world in my own way but as time goes by maybe I'm just meant to be ordinary may be my only. Maybe my purpose is to do something big for the world but just to be there for the people who care about me maybe that's my purpose and that something that I can live with

## 2016-01-09T05:59:00.000Z - is Almost 8,000,000,000 People on This Planet and Sometimes I Feel like I'm the only One

Not in a depressed kind of way but in a robotic kind of way. I feel like I'm becoming more more withdrawn from natural emotions. i'm sure a lot of it has to deal with the Adderall but I can remember parts of my life before the Adderall where I just wasn't quite normal.
This conversation I'm having with myself right now is highly due to not getting any sleep yesterday.
I don't even know what the point of having this or talking to this piece of technology in front of me, I don't even know if anybody will ever read it. I'm sure if anybody reads it there going to be quite disappointed. I have achieved nothing but failure it seems

If God does exist, I think he washed his hands of us. How is this world any better than it was before the flood? Today's terrorists and evil tyrants are much more worse than anything back then. I think he realized that humans are too flawed in a sense that even good men can be corrupted. If God is real, he's not paying any attention to a world that just wants to destroy itself. What do we do with things that don't work or that are broken? We try to fix it and when it doesn't go the way we want to, we throw it out. We abandon it, just as he has us.

I've Had Black Betty for 8 Years and She's Always Been Good to Me, Too Bad I Can't Say that I've Been Too Good to Her. 204,000 Miles 3.4 Litr Engine. Brand New Tires. Runs Great. But....... Brake Lights Don't Seem to Work Anymore and there is Zero Heat. We Changed Thermostat and Checked out the inside Electronics. I Think the Heater Core Needs to Be Flushed but I Don't Know. I'm not Putting Any Money into It, it just Needs to Go to a New Owner. $800 Cash. I Will Consider Trades for Certain Electronics like a MacBook or Something along Those Lines. I'll post Pictures when I Get time to Clean it out

We watched the new Star Wars for 2 reasons. 1st because it was directed by JJ Abrams and 2nd because there was literally nothing else to watch. I still don't get all the hype with these movies. I give it a 2 out of 5 and that is only because of JJ Abrams. Hate all you fanboys want but I simply can not get into that series

"Finding things that make you happy shouldn't be so hard. I know you'll face pain, suffering, hard choices but you can't let the weight of it choke the joy out of your life. No matter what, you have to find the things that love you. Run to them. There's an old saying - that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger, I don't believe that. I think the things that try to kill you make you angry and sad. Strength comes from the good things, your family, your friends, the satisfaction of hard work. Those are the things that will keep you whole, those are the things to hold onto when you're broken."~Jax Teller

We Are Triumphant
As some of you may have noticed, Wander‚Äôs Facebook page is no longer active. Yesterday around noon time, I was kicked out of Facebook, while I was using it, and received the following message; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve removed or disabled access to the following content that you posted on Facebook because a third party reported that the content infringes or otherwise violates their trademark rights.‚Äù Needless to say, I was pretty shocked. We have known that we share a name with another band for a while now and they have known about us too. We have peacefully coexisted for over two years and have never heard so much as a word from them about a trademark or anything like that; until July 28th. On July 28th we received an e-mail from their label telling us to stop using our name. I‚Äôm no expert on trademark law and I don‚Äôt pretend to be, but I do know that in the United States of America a trademark is something that is very subjective and somewhat difficult to enforce.
There are a lot of extremely pliant criteria that have to be met when enforcing a trademark such as; similarity of the conflicting marks, relatedness or proximity of the two companies, strength of the senior user‚Äôs mark, marketing channels used, degree of care likely to be used by purchasers in selecting the goods, the "second comers" intent in selecting its mark, evidence of actual confusion, and likelihood of expansion in product lines (http://www.copylaw.com/new_articles/trademrk.html). I realize that when you look at the similarities between our band and the other band, we meet almost, if not, all of this criteria; you will hear no argument from me. But the similar names and enforcing of the trademark is not the problem. The problem is, these circumstances and similarities have existed for over two years and they are just now deciding to enforce the trademark less than a month before the biggest thing we have ever done is going to be released; our sophomore full-length album. Is this a coincidence? Probably not. This band possessed this trademark long before they released their album in March of 2016, don‚Äôt you think it would‚Äôve been in their best interest to enforce their trademark against us before their release so they could gain maximum traction?
But they didn‚Äôt. They waited until after we had already spent thousands of dollars on merchandise, press and promotion for the release, waiting until the last possible second before our most substantial release. As far as we are concerned, this was a deliberate attack, a calculated, malicious, and predatory business move.
To tie this up, we don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs going on yet. The party enforcing the trademark has possession of our Facebook page and will not release it until we have changed our name to something they approve of. I‚Äôm expecting our Twitter and Instagram pages will soon suffer the same fate. All we know for certain is that our new album ‚ÄúPrecipice‚Äù is still coming out in eight days and it is the best thing we have ever done. Please continue to support us and buy the record if you can afford it; we are going to need all the help we can get in the coming months.
Thank you all,
Jack, Brett, Andy and Danny

Everett

She said "this is for the best, I don't care if you think I'm being selfish"
I replied with "he's all that I have left, what am I suppose to do without him?"
She said "I don't care what you do, cause we're leaving when the courts say we can move"
I replied with "what did I do to you to deserve all this hell you've put me through?"

I haven't slept in days and I hate being awake, knowing there's nothing I can do to stop you now. You're on your way traveling 2000 miles away, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think. I don't want to think without you

What do you say since you've been over there, do you tell him that I just don't care?
What will you say when he wonders about me?
Will you tell him that life's not fair or that it's my fault that you're over there?
What do you feel when he talks about me?

She said "this is for the best, I dont care if you think I'm being selfish"
I replied with "How do you know what's best, when we both know he doesn't understand this?"
She said "I don't care what you think, cause come December we are moving out of this state"
I replied with "I'll never understand how you could be so damn cold when were so close"

Three years later and everything's the same, I've spent everyday blaming myself for things I couldn't change.

What does he say when he's over there, does he ask you if I even care?
What do you tell him about me?
Do you say that I'm doing my best or that I'm just a loser like all the rest?
What will it take to make this right?

Your room in blue

Let's take this back to 02 when it was just me and you and the world was so small. Let's take the bikes down the boardwalk and throw rocks in the river, can we stop for ice cream?

This was you and I on those april nights painting your room in blue, we signed our initials and I got paint all over you. Do you remember?

Let's take this back to the summer of 05, where there's a baby and a bottle and getting up all night. You were there but I was not, I missed the best parts of his entire first year

And I'm sorry, you know that I am sorry. Can we please just get along? I am holding onto my head to keep it intact cause you know that I was wrong.

We were lovers without friendship and fighting was all we knew, but god we were just kids.

You hurt me and I hurt you, in the end it's all we knew. I'm trying to keep my head in tact cause I was wrong but so were you.

Everyone has something to say about me to you, and I'll take my share of the blame if you do too.

Let's take this to the present, we hardly speak anymore, is it because I couldn't let go or is it something more?
Its been four years and I'm learning to forgive, we had Everett together but now it's like I don't exist

I've grown up enough to know you did what you had to do, but its the simple things that still keep me confused. One day I hope we can grow as friends, you don't know what it's like to be on my end.

So let's take this back to that fall night when we first met, let's start over and let's be friends

Kristin

If you're listening, I want you to know that I'm sorry for all the nights I stood you up. I'm sorry for not owning up to every hurtful thing I did when I was out of my mind. You were my best friend, is this how we will end?

As I lay awake and I toss and turn
I know that I do not deserve you to ever forgive me for what I've done

Growing up is getting old
Is it worse to hold on or to let go?
I can't mak...

## 2016-10-07T02:14:05.000Z - I Think Stevie is Gonna Leave Me Soon, Can't Say that I Blame Her. I Don't Know if Its Depression or from the Adderall or Maybe Both, but I Am Unable to Look forward to Anything Anymore. I'm Stuck in Limbo, I Don't Know how to Hold Conversations, It's Ironic She Always Thinks I'm Talking to Someone Else, the Truth is I Don't Talk to Anyone, Shit I Probably Talk to Myself More than Anyone Else. My Kids Hate Me, I'm not a Father and I'm Probably the Furthest Thing from a Role Model and You Know what the Worst part Is? I Don't even Fucking Care. The only Thing I Feel is 20 Minutes of Euphoria when after I Take My Adderall and then I Feel Numbness or Anger. What a Life. I Hate to Say it but I Wish My Kids Never Had Any of My Dna, That's a less Shitty Version of Saying I Wish They Weren't Mine. I Suck, I Should just Fucking End My Life Right now while They're Still Young and I Don't Fuck up Their Lives Anymore
