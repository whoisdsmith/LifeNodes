## 2015-01-21T13:35:50.000Z - I Ended Mine and Stevie's 3 Year Relationship

She just doesn't want anything to do with me anymore

## 2015-01-24T21:40:00.000Z - Sunset. Passionate Kiss

These things mean nothing when you cannot come to terms with
The person who you are, and who you're meant to be
Are separated by a sea of insecurities.
I've been digging out from underneath
An avalanche that has taken twenty years to see.
Our reality is our own to create,
And the sooner that you realize that
The sooner that you can change.
Or history will just hit repeat
And you will pass your poison down onto your child's feet.
And they will struggle, struggle to breathe,
Cowering in shadows that you cast they cannot see.

## 2015-01-26T20:31:29.000Z - 1st Day after Starting Our Relationship over

Woke up 5am

Worked 6-2

Stevie and I talked about short term and long term goals.

Stevie is beyond depressed and keeps hinting towards suicide

Got home at 330

She's not very interested in me or the kids

I feel very sad, I don't know what to do

I want to help her but what if she's never happy again? What will that do to me?

## 2015-04-03T05:24:00.000Z - is the #1 Relationship that I Regret the Most. Long Term Side Effects Were not Available 8 Years Ago. I Can Tell You from 8 Years of Experience that the long Term Effects Are Catastrophic. It Completely Cripples Your Mind, Your Behavior and Everything You Care About. I've Been in Denial for the Last Few Months, I Didn't want to Believe the One Thing to Make Me Better Was Actually Making Everything Worse. Sure I Am to Focus and Clean Shit like a Coke Head but in return I've Lost Bits and Pieces of both long Term and short Term Memory. I Developed a Whole New Personality and it even Changed My Food and Beverage Preferences. I've Developed Social Anxiety so Bad that I Won't Leave the House unless it is an Absolute Necessity. Now These Are just a Few of the Side Effects, Definitely Enough to just Stop Taking the Shit Right? Well I Am Sad to Say the Journey to Recovery Has no Set Completion Date. I Went through a time Period in 2009 and 2012 without Taking Them because I Could not Afford the Doctor Bill or the Prescription, Those 2-3 Months I Had to Live without Adderall Were the Worst Months of My Life. I Slept an Average of 18 Hrs a Day, I Could Function only to Get out of Bed and Eat , Go to the Bathroom and then Maybe Shower. After that Daunting Task Was over I Would Go back to Sleep Again. This Happened Every Day until I Got My Prescription Back. The time Has Finally come where the Bad Outweighs the Good and I Have Chosen to Stop Taking it Altogether. I Hope to Eventually return to My Happy and Social Self One Day, but These next Few Months I Believe Are Going to Tough and not just for Me but for My Family Too. That is All for now

“Sometimes, it’s easy to feel like you’re the only one in the world who’s struggling, who’s frustrated, or unsatisfied, or barely getting by. That feeling is a lie. And if you just hold on, just find the courage to face it all for another day, someone or something will find you and make it all okay, because we all need a little help sometimes, someone to help us hear the music in the world, to remind us that it won’t always be this way. That someone is out there, and that someone will find you.” Lucas Scott

These things mean nothing when you cannot come to terms with the person who you are, and who you're meant to be are separated by a sea of insecurities. I've been digging out from underneath an avalanche and it's taken twenty years to see, our reality is our own to create, and the sooner that you realize that sooner that you can change, or history will just hit repeat
and you will pass your poison down onto your child's feet, and they will struggle, struggle to breathe, cowering in shadows that you cast they cannot see. I won't repeat the things that I can change.

## 2015-06-14T04:04:00.000Z - Going to Be a long Night and an even Longer Day Tomorrow. As much as I Hate Moving I Have to Admit Stevie and I Have it down to a Science. When it Comes to Packing and Loading the Uhaul, Every Box and Piece of Furniture is Stacked Floor to Ceiling in what Looks like an Epic Game of Tetris. We Could Totally Start Our Own Moving Company and I Came up with a Perfect name for it "Fuck Moving" Seriously Fuck Moving

## 2015-07-22T05:41:00.000Z - not into Politics or Religion, I Wish Everyone Could just Get Along. Now More than Ever Social Networks Are Flooding Newsfeeds with Propaganda Bullshit and Fueling People's Hate towards the Government, towards the Gays and towards Religion

To me, life is all about finding your path to what makes you happy. I've always kept an open mind about everything, I hate political debates because all they do is fuel hatred towards the opposite party. I understand we all have our own views and opinions but attacking someone because of their race, political views, sexual preference or religion isn't helping to solve a single issue.
I know a lot of people who's views consist of "There's nothing worse than a faggot loving nigger who's an atheist and a democrat"
I'm pretty sure there are a lot of things worse, here's an example.
Your attitude.
Instead of getting all bent out of shape because the gays can legally marry, or the government bans a flag or someone doesn't go to the same church or even church at all, we could be using that time to do something positive and proactive. I don't care if you're gay as shit, or if you're democratic or republican or if you live your life by a book written thousands of years ago or by a book written by Tom Cruise. The point is if you're nice to me and you don't fly planes into buildings, I'll be nice to you. I don't really care about all this gay ass fucking (pun intended) drama that's doing nothing but spreading hate and negativity. I get on Facebook to see how friends and family are doing not to see an endless feed of hate, it's Facebook not Fox News. You have just as much right to bitch about the things you believe in whether you agree with me or not but if you're going to argue over your views just stop and ask yourself if anything positive will come from it or if you're just contributing to the endless cycle of hate.
Lately my news feed has gotten so bad that I just scroll down to view the Facebook ads which is really sad and disappointing.
Ok rant is over
