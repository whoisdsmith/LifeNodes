## 2014-01-03T05:14:00.000Z - if time Travel is Possible in the Future and We Were Able to Go back to a Specific point in Our Lives whether it Be to Change Something or Relive Our Last Moment with Someone We Lost

What if some of us have already traveled back to what we know now as the present day but in doing so our memories have no knowledge of who we were or what we did in the future, so we have no idea what it is we wanted to change or relive.
That's one of the many jumbled thoughts my mind spits out at night when I can't sleep

2014-04-11-081200

If you must change, change for the better. Don't change into someone you will grow to hate just to accommodate the person who claims to care about you. Some peoples genetics were infused with too much negativity. You could paint a canvas of all the great things they have in life and surround them with it and the only thing they will notice is how crooked the easel is or that the paint dripped onto the carpet.

Lydia Skye Smith is 3 days old and continuing to melt my heart each and every minute of the day.

Watched an episode of Believe with my loves.

Finished up some yard work after Lydia fell asleep.

Took Stevie and Lydia on a long walk down the boardwalk, we stopped and saw my buddy Will Pond on the way home.

Fired up the grill and had our first picnic of the spring outside with Lydia.

Been doing my best to give Lydia and Stevie all of my love and attention.

I hope that each new day continues to bring love, happiness, positivity and patience in this family. I am living out my dreams of being a better father, lover, friend and person.

Stevie brought me lunch today at 10:50 so that was awesome and delicious. Thanks babe!

Lydia had her first doctor appointment today! Everything looks good!

Got out of work at 2:30

Ate breakfast for once

Dolores picked me up for work

Had 6am meeting

Just wasn't feeling it in the morning. Got good sleep and breakfast for once but maybe that was the problem

Stevie and I fought all morning about getting married. She just doesn't get it that I do want to marry her I'm just in no rush. I want it to be a good wedding not something that was just thrown together to get it done

## 2014-05-04T23:00:00.000Z - So much for the New Furniture

That was a waste of $80 and a waste of energy.

I thought I had my anger under control, it seems that it still has control over me.

If I can't get rid of it, than I need to find a way to use it in a positive way.

## 2014-05-05T22:54:06.000Z - I Emailed Rick at 5am to Tell Him I Wouldn't Be in to Work Today, Super Bummed that I Did That. I Let Myself down and I Feel Unreliable now

Woke up at 10am

Stevie got mcds breakfast

We watched an episode of believe

Did a lot of nothing on the pc

Helped give Lydia a bath

Watched kickass 2 with Stevie

Did a lot of more nothing

I'm in such a weird mood lately, like I feel like the lights on upstairs in my brain but nobody's home.

I don't want to do anything lately and the adderall isn't helping either.

This was quite a wasteful and unproductive day and I am quite disappointed in myself.

## 2014-05-10T17:56:41.000Z - Woke up 515

Had to work on deburr

Out at 2

Need to make this a habit again!

It's been almost two weeks since I have felt normal. I feel as if my mind is empty and I can't help but stare into the void of nothingness. I hate these phases

## 2014-05-11T16:00:00.000Z - Started Feeling Better Today

I was in this off mood for two weeks or so and then all of a sudden I wake up and shits normal again. I don't understand why that happens, it's been like that my whole life.

## 2014-05-26T21:53:41.000Z - Woke up at 8am

Everett woke up around 7-7:30

Got around and went to the Tekonsha parade

Started getting really bad anxiety around 9:45

Everett got tons of candy from the parade and decided to eat half of it

Saw the Goheens for a few, told them we would stop by but we never made it

Went to Great Grandparents for chicken dinners

Everett was starting to get a little wild

Stevie started getting anxiety around 12pm when Everett started being more of a wild child

Stevie and I had it out a little bit over parenting shit.

I took my negative energy out on all the skipping rocks down by the river

Taught Everett how to skip rocks, we had a good time

Left around 2pm

Came home and watched Xmen, still a little tension between all of us

Stevie said she forgot to take her celexa so that explains why she was freaking out all day

6pm firing up the grill, hoping the last few hours of the day are ok because my 3 day weekend is now over

I don't like to hate anything but when I do, it's internet trolls and fake ass news articles. What a life they must have, sitting in front of their screen writing bullshit stories with one hand while they're fisting their asshole with the other. Somebody should cut their fingers off, and their tongue out for being so stupid.

Been throwing the football around quite a bit with Everett, he is pretty damn good at catching and throwing a mean spiral! My mom got him a pretty sweet set of golf clubs for his birthday last year and we tested them out last night but he thinks they are like hockey sticks and plays like Happy Gilmore. I am probably one of the worst golfers on the planet so Im not sure I could teach him to do any better lol

I think my biggest disappointments are always in myself. It's too easy to be lazy and once you start getting lazy it gets too comfortable to not be anything else. Im going to change that because I want to be the kind of person that people want to be around and the kind of father that my kids are proud of. I know that if I'm disappointed in myself than surely others must be disappointed in me as well. So now that I've acknowledged the situation, I will take care of it.

I just want him to be happy and give him a better life than I have before but I keep failing and somedays I can't help but feel like a piece of shit, damn.

12:04 PM
A few years ago I fell hostage to some serious depression, I was unhappy for no reason at all, my mind made me believe that nobody cared about me. I drank a lot and I did a lot of stupid shit I never thought I would do. I was convinced my life would never get better and that no one would miss me if I was gone. It got to the point that one night I wrote my own obituary, when I woke up the next day, I read that obituary over and over and I realized that I needed help and I needed to talk to someone.
That is what I did. Family, friends and music saved my life and pulled me out of the grave I had been digging. Depression isn't something that gets better over night, its an everyday struggle that eventually (and by eventually I mean months to years) gets better over time. Stevie Marie Linnabary this is for you, because you were the last hand to pull me out of that darkness. I am so thankful that I found the strength to keep waking up every day no matter how hard the struggle was. Had I chosen the other path I would not be here writing this today, Lydia wouldn't be here and Everett would have grown up knowing his father was a coward who took the easy way out.
I have listened to this album for the last month over and over, I wish I could have had this when I was in such a dark place. This is for anyone who is in that dark place. Hold on to your friends, your family and that little bit of hope that keeps you waking up every day, because no matter how shitty you think your life is right now, it WILL get better and one day this could be you holding your child and writing words to light the way for those who are lost.

I Had My Daughter in My Left Arm, She Was Covered in Tiny Pieces of Glass, My Son Was inside Listening to Me and Stevie Yelling and Screaming, He Was Fully Aware of what Was Going on and what Had Happened. All of This Happened because Stevie Got Irritated with Everett Jumping around and Me not Punishing Him for It. I Didn't Think He Was Being Bad and Shouldn't Be Punished. She Thought Otherwise. I Walked Away. I Always Walk Away, because if I Don't Walk away My Fist Ends up in the Wall or My Leg Smashes through a Coffee Table or I Destroy whatever Object is in front of Me.

No matter what, you have to find the things that love you. Run to them. There's an old saying - that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger, I don't believe that. I think the things that try to kill you make you angry and sad. Strength comes from the good things, your family, your friends, the satisfaction of hard work. Those are the things that will keep you whole, those are the things to hold onto when you're broken."~Jax Teller

I'm Happy with the way My Life Has Turned out and that I've Been Blessed with My Daughter and Sons. I Realize now that is the only Goal That's Ever Really Worth Having and Achieving.

My short Term Memory is Complete Shit so Everything I Read or Hear Has to Be Repeated over and over and over until My Brain Finally Gets it and by then I'm Usually Bored or Tired of whatever it is I'm Trying to Learn.

## 2014-10-14T16:45:00.000Z - Happiness is much like DNA, It's Different for Everyone. What Makes You Happy May not Be the Same Guidelines that Make Others Happy. To Me, Happiness is Something that Should not Be Felt 100% of the Time, if You Are Never Sad or Angry than how Do You Know You Are Happy? Happiness Should Be a Reminder of All the Things You Love and that Make You Smile but not Something that Should Stick around long Enough that You Forget to Appreciate Its Value. Instead, You Can Choose to Always Be Grateful. If You Believe that Money or Medicine or a New Relationship Will Make You Find Happiness, than You Will Always Be Looking for More Money, More Doctors or More People. We Are All Capable of Being Happy, the Key is to Define it Yourself and to Be Grateful for the Things You Have even after All of Your Misfortunes. That's a Start Anyways

Yup! iTools is a great software, ifunbox, and also iexplorer is good as well I totally misread that, the above mentioned software will not help unless the phone is jailbroken

Whatitiz2burn on Dualboot advice
I currently boot Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Yosemite but I put all 3 OS on separate hard drives none of which are SSD (unfortunately) it took a lot of patience and frustration trying to get everything to play well together. I found it was best to read many guides and forums from all sources not just a single source like tonymac a‚Ä¶

A few weeks ago I posted a video of Notch's (creater of minecraft) $70,000,000 mansion in CA. I assumed he spent most of what he got from selling the game to Microsoft on that house, that was until I read he sold his company Mojang along with minecraft to Microsoft for 2.5 billion dollars. $2,500,000,000!!! For a game with 1990's graphics and cost very little to create. My mind is blown right now. 2.5 billion dollars and the dude is only 5 years older than me. Damn!
