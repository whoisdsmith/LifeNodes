Hey Pops,
Im doing pretty good, Ive been up in Grand Rapids since June 15th, Emily is finally is rehab...Shes doing amazing!!! She is going to make a full recovery with everything except her legs...but shes tough and shes been keeping her head up! Shes got 8 more weeks up here and then she can finally come home.
I did indeed ask her to marry me, we talked about it quite a bit even before her accident..and of course she said yes!!! We haven't set a date yet but Ill send you and Jim an invitation when we do.. Im not one to make big leaps like this if I wasn't certain of the outcome...but its not everyday you walk away from a good job and good people unless its for a good cause...I do miss you guys a lot and I do wish things were different...Id rather be there sweating balls with you and Jimmie then sitting here in Grand Rapids...We all wish we had a time machine at one point or another in our lives but fate is something you cant out run or change..
I got accepted to KCC in battle creek and Im going back full time starting in sept...I cashed out my 401k and declared bankruptcy, I paid off all the bills that I had, and paid all the remaining bills ahead for the next 6 months..I haven't really been working on anything except helping Emily recover, Ive learned alot about nursing, therapy and medice along the way..I find myself slacking off at times with trying to get motivated and then I see you in the back of my mind telling me to get my ass back to work haha..
So all in all I think everything going to be alright..Itd be nice to catch a beer sometime if you ever got any free time...i got a new # so call me if you wanna get together 269.832.4016
take care
D.S. Jr. hahaha

Reach For the Sun
There is a band out there called “The Dangerous Summer” and they made a record titled “Reach For the Sun.” It is by far the most amazing record of 2009. It hits home and hits hard. The Dangerous Summer are a force to be reckoned with.
The band is led by singer-songwriter A.J. Perdomo. A.J. writes all the music and all of the lyrics. Everything this kid writes is nothing short of amazing. In his short 18 years, he has been through a lot and accomplished a lot. At 15 he was signed to Hopeless Records to show off his amazing talent. In the 3 years that followed that triumph, he was kicked out by his mom, lived in a car, lost his faith and felt useless. During this time he wrote “Reach For the Sun” an 11 song record that is all about going crazy and finding yourself again. It is an album a lot of people out there can relate to.
The first half of “Reach For the Sun” is an emotional roller coaster. From the opening song, you can tell the hurt and anguish this kid has gone through. The first line out of this kid’s mouth was “In the back of my mind, well I fought my God, cause of all the hell that’s in my time.” A.J. paints a picture with every line he sings. The listener can almost feel the emotion he was going through. There is a few lines that really stick out through the first half of this record. “Don’t let them try and save me, cause I’m already crazy” “Well I’m an optimist but only in a perfect world, I think I’m too stained with all the negativity from all the people in my way” “Can you hear me? Well I don’t even care. I’ll stop my screaming if you look the other way, it’s been a bad year so let me sleep in one more day.”
The second half of “Reach For the Sun” is more on how to find yourself again, It is all about believing in hope and that hope exists, it just has to be worked for. A.J. is one of the few young writers that can make you feel his pain and feel his hope. This record is one that everyone should own, when they have lost their way. It will captivate you, motivate you, and send chills down your spine. Reach for the sun is going to be to this generation, what Nirvana’s Nevermind was to the90’s generation.
The Dangerous Summer is an unstoppable force and such an amazing talent. I recommend you pick up their new record “Reach For the Sun“ Hopefully it will touch you as it has touched many others. If you are in search of something new and something inspiring, this band is your answer.
