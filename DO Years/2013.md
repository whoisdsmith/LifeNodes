5 more hours and then another 16 hr round trip to take the kiddo home. This is always the hardest part, 6 months between each visit is too long, but that's just the way shit goes at least I got two weeks of bonding time. I always hope these times are as memorable for him as they are for me

## 2013-01-18T03:27:17.150Z - These Are the Words I Don't want to Forget to Say and the Feelings that I Can't Let You Forget

First off I just want to say how sorry I am for all the things that happened especially last night there were things I said that I did not mean I was just caught up in here the moment and I'm really sorry for that. I'm trying to be a better man but I'm not perfect I am human and I am flawed and I am a mess at times but I really do love you and I could not live a life without you. I did not mean the things I said last night about you wanting to control my life or about me blaming you for my job and for me saying I hated my life.. if anything you have done nothing but make my life better. Most of all I'm really sorry for saying things I said about our son. I have no excuses for that.... I was caught up in the moment and you were trying to say things to get under my skin and I took the worst thing I could find and tried to hurt you with that. I am a man who made some mistakes and I'm always going to make mistakes but I'm doing my best to learn from them I will never love anybody but you... I will never care about another woman other than you... I don't want anybody else, you are my life. I'm writing this to tell you that no matter where we are in, life no matter how bad things get I'm never going to give up on you because you have not given up on me and we need each other we just need to learn to grow as a couple and as a family. I apologize for not giving you as much attention as you want I get caught up in my music and I don't do it on purpose it just happens but no matter what, the music will never be more important than you. I know that's how you feel sometimes but I don't know how to explain it... Music is the one thing I am good at and because of you and only because of you I get to do this every day and I lose sight of what's really important and I'm trying to focus on you and on our future, But if there was no more me and you then the music would mean nothing. it's what you do to me it's how you inspire me and what you make me feel that motivates me to want to push myself as a musician as a father as a lover and I just don't know how to show it and I'm sorry. All I want is for you to be happy and I admit at times I'm selfish but work with me baby. You are all I've ever wanted! I love you!

## 2013-02-14T01:18:34.000Z - I Was just Laying here Thinking about Our Lives. How Many times We've Ended Our Nights Sleeping Separately and how Many times We've Told Each other Hateful Things. I Hate that I Am not the Girl Who Makes Your Life Easier, and More Enjoyable. I Hate that I Look in the Mirror and See a Girl Who Isn't Able to Make the Man She Loves, Happy. We Have Our Good Days. By the End of the Good Days I Feel I Make You More Angry than Happy. I've Made You Enjoy Your time away from Me More than Our time Together. I've Smothered You. I've Made You Lose Control. I Don't Know whether You Would Be Better off without Me... The Last Few Days Have Been the Worst for Me. I Feel so Alone and Confused and I Don't Know what to Do. I Love You so Much, I just Know that Being as Distant as We Have Been is Going to Take Me into a Depression and I Don't Know how to Handle It. You Don't Have to Respond or Talk to Me about This I just Wanted to Let You Know that I Love You no Matter What, if Taking You off Your Meds Makes You Realize that I Can't Make You Happy Anymore, and We Drift Apart, just Know that I Loved You with Every Inch of My Heart and Tht I Always Will. Don't Make This Guilt You into Anything; I just Honestly Never Felt so Scared to Lose Another Person in My Life. I just want You to Truly Be Happy, I Hope that We Make it through This and Can Be Happy in Eachothers Lives once Again. I just want to Be the Girl of Your Dreams not Your Nightmares... I Love You Dustin

Stevie

## 2013-02-27T01:19:18.000Z - I Appreciate what You Do. I Know You're Slowly Getting Better, but You Know how Hard it is to Wait for Our Child to Be Born and Watch Him Die. To Wait for Our Wedding Day to come and We Came even Get through the Courts. To want to Bring Another Child Tht is Mine and Yours into This World, only for U Tovmake an Excuse why We Cant. And to want so Badly to Stain My Ink with the Man I want to Marry only for Him to Tell Me I Have to Wait. In the Pit of My Gut I Know You Don't want to Do Anything Permanent for Me. I Guess if You Don't want to Be with Me and You Know it Might not Last, why Do You Stay with Me? I've Seen You Play Romeo, Am I just not Your Juliet? I just want You to Do Something You Say You're Going to Do, for Once, no Waiting. No Planning. Just Go out and Do It, for Me. If not I Don't want to Be on Your Sidelines Forever Dustin I want to Move Our Lives forward and Do Fun and Crazy Exciting Things. Who Care if We Get Tattoos. That's what Lovers Do. I'm just Tired of Being the Last Girl You've Ever Made an Effort for and I Hope You Know how much It's Killing me.Stevie

Hung around till 10

Watched footloose

Mood is annoyance and irritated I don't know why, I feel like we are stuck in limbo. We know what issues we have, we know how to change them but we lack the willpower, we are in a world that's on continuous replay. The record might play the next song but it's still going to be the same album. We need hope and courage to move forward, to change albums from sad to excitement. I need that, she needs that, we all need that.

There are no strings attached to us, we are not being directed by some puppeteer. The choice is ours to make a difference but it seems our choices have been hidden or replaced by other distractions

## 2013-06-19T19:28:03.000Z - I Miss My Friends, I Hate Feeling like I Can't Talk to Them because Stevie Has Tied Them to Some part of My Past.. She's Made Me Feel so Shitty towards Anything that She Wasn't Involved In

I've kept calm, I've tried to show sympathy but it's just never good enough, she lets her insecurities run her life and run our relationship. All I've ever wanted was to just be happy! Happy with her and with Everett and with Cam, but she won't ever see that, all she sees is what I've done in my past and how I was a fucking Romeo to everyone but her.

Why have I stayed here this long? Because I thought she would grow up,

If you take the time to look at the people around you, you will always find someone whose life is a little bit worse than yours. The thing I find most inspiring about them, is they are usually the ones who are smiling the most because even though they might not have as much money or clothes as the next person, they are thankful for what they do have and they appreciate it. I want to live my life with that positive attitude cause if those who have less than I me are happier than I am than I've been doing everything all wrong. So next time you open your mouth to bitch about something you think is so bad in your life, take a look at the people around you and take notes on how to be a better person.

If you could take a step back and view your life through the eyes of someone else, would you like the person see? Would you be proud of who you are? Or would you realize that there are a lot of things you need to change and maybe you aren't as perfect as you once thought, because what you see in the mirror and how other people view you may be entirely different.

I feel like everything in this world is fueled by negativity, greed and hate. Why, cause it's always been that way. It always will be if we continue to do everything our ancestors before us have done.
I came from a good family, I've had a good life and I know that not everyone is so lucky. I wasn't raised to dislike someone because of their skin color, beliefs or sexuality. I was brought up to respect everyone and to treat people with care whether they treat you the same or not.
I've got two sons and another baby on the way and when I picture them growing up in the future I find myself having to worry more than I am being excited for them.
The bullying, the violence, the need to have more than you need, power, greed and everything else that is feeding into negative energy.
I can't solve the worlds problems but I can help by showing my kids how to properly treat others, that it's not ok to discriminate or bully or shun those who happen to like the same sex.

This is just another way you can tell that life is truly unfair cause if life was fair it would have been one of you assholes in that car instead. So just let that sink in for awhile and then continue on being a fuckin dick.

Leave earlier, drive slower and come home to the people who love you.

One of the reasons we are failing as human beings is that we put so much effort into criticizing the opinions of others. It's a free country. While you complain and get butt hurt over what people have said, there are people and children that are hungry and homeless.
We know this, but we choose to ignore it because we would rather argue about the opinion of some dude from a TV show.

Maybe one day the cool kids will be the ones who treat others with love and compassion.
Maybe one day success will be seen as how much you have contributed to better the world, rather than how much money you make.
Maybe one day the outcasts or losers will be the ones who are hateful and disrespectful to others.
Maybe one day that day could be today and you could take that first step toward helping solve the problems of the world.
Isn't this the world we want for our children? It is our children who are going to be future leaders and it is our responsibility not only as parents but as human beings to guide them in the right direction.
