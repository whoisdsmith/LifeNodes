---Quick start with Terminal — Useful commands you should know | by Carla Martins | CodeX | Medium
Excerpt

Introduction
---
The most important commands in a terminal are:

pwd
tree
cd
ls
mkdir
cat
mv
rm / rmdir
diff
head / tail
grep
pwd
This command shows the directory where the user is located. This command is important so that the user can locate himself within the tree of directories and files that make up Unix systems. In the image below, we can see in the upper part that user is in the directory pixel, that is a sub-directory of Users.![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*H1F_YmsP4bTjOTz--5vx9Q.png?q=20)
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/278/1*H1F_YmsP4bTjOTz--5vx9Q.png)
Image 1. Using the pwd command to check that user is at home directory.

In the next image, the user is in the directory unix_command_line, a sub-directory of Desktop.
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*cJD_49cwxPHXi2GtGqwP0A.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*cJD_49cwxPHXi2GtGqwP0A.png)
Image 2. Using the pwd command to check that user is at unix_command_line directory.
tree
The tree command displays the folder and file structure of the current directory visually. I used the tree command inside my unix_command_line folder and the output is shown in figure 2. The tree command also prints the number of directories and files. We can use the tree command to help us navigate in the directories and find paths to files.
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/58/1*niBHfFB4d7AkAo7kdrU_SQ.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/508/1*niBHfFB4d7AkAo7kdrU_SQ.png)
Image 3. Example of the output of tree command.

cd

The command change directory (cd) is used to navigate inside the directories. If you are in your home directory, and you want to go inside unix_command_line directory that is in your Desktop, just type: cd /Desktop/unix_command_line. You can confirm now you are inside unix_command_line by using pwd.
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*U1VIPHHqbTD-jR2cziUvAg.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/710/1*U1VIPHHqbTD-jR2cziUvAg.png)
Image 4. cd command to access unix_command_line directory.

To return one level to the parent directory, use cd .., and to return to your home directory type cd ~.
ls
You can use the command ls (list) to display files and folder names inside a directory. The charm of ls command is the list of options you can add. If we use the basic ls command inside unix_command_line directory, we will have all the files and directories inside unix_command_line directory displayed.
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*XbjBrsShqfjMIOZd1DAX_Q.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1256/1*XbjBrsShqfjMIOZd1DAX_Q.png)
Image 5. ls command inside unix_command_line directory.

But now we can go further and try some options of the ls command. With -a option, we instruct our machine to show even the hide files. You can see the difference in image 6, where it is possible to find the files “.” and “. . “.
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*a2HUYhN-JAHtsGa1cZxHww.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1248/1*a2HUYhN-JAHtsGa1cZxHww.png)
Image 6. ls command inside unix_command_line directory with the option -a.

With the -R option, it is possible to see what is inside the sub-directories of unix_command_line directory, as you can see in image 7.
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ntRIOhe_Yp3RAC3wwRbN0w.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1260/1*ntRIOhe_Yp3RAC3wwRbN0w.png)
Image 7. ls command inside unix_command_line directory with the option -R.

To see the size and permissions of the files and directories inside unix_command_line, just use the option -lh.
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*DyCLVbyi__msXycw9c6u-w.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1380/1*DyCLVbyi__msXycw9c6u-w.png)
Image 8. ls command inside unix_command_line directory with the option -lh.

mkdir

To create a new directory, the command mkdir (make directory) can be used in two ways. The first one, you move using cd to the directory where you want to create a new directory. Just use cd Desktop/unix_command_line and then mkdir folder_5.
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*39IpofHQU3zmiDPVwktMkQ.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1258/1*39IpofHQU3zmiDPVwktMkQ.png)
Image 9. Creating a new directory using mkdir.

With the second option, you use the command mkdir specifying the path where we want to the new directory using mkdir Desktop/unix_command_line/folder_5 from home directory.
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*OD0KQhGwO5W0A18HwX7qeA.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/928/1*OD0KQhGwO5W0A18HwX7qeA.png)
Image 10. Creating a new directory using mkdir by specifying a path from home directory.

cat

The cat command stands for concatenate. It is a versatile command that can be used for more than one function. We can use cat to create a tex...

---5 ‘fun’ things to do with Terminal that will help you learn the Command Line | by Ed Packard | Medium
Excerpt

This week I began the pre-course at Makers Academy: this consists of a veritable smorgasbord of learning activities that will (hopefully!)…
---1. Say something
With a Terminal window open and your volume turned up, type say followed by a space and some text of your choice, then hit return.

say hello

or

say “I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that"

This is great fun for about thirty seconds, but there is a bit more to this command than meets the eye. Try out the man command with say to read about a range of switches (options) which, among other things, provide customisation options for the sound of the voice:

man say

You can use the -f switch to get the voice to read the text from a file on your computer. Create a text file called hello.txt in your current directory ( touch hello.txt will do the trick), fill it with words using a text editor, save, and then run the following in the Terminal:

say -f hello.txt

The say command also provides a good workout for using pipes. If you have forgotten your own name, ask the Terminal to tell you:

whoami | say (contrast the output from this with say whoami - this is a simple but effective lesson in what pipes do in redirecting output streams)

If you’re up to speed with env variables, you could always try echo $USER | say instead.

You can also get pretty meta with this command: man say | say

The speech synthesiser obviously has some limitations, but messing around with say ’s switches and pipes is really good (and generally harmless) practice in some basic command line techniques.
2. Save the date
What is today’s date? The date command will tell you (and, funnily enough, the command date | say will adjust the speech output to sound more natural: give both commands a try and note the difference in the text and spoken outputs).

But what if you wanted to find out if any historical events or notable birthdays occurred on a particular day? Or even what was going on in Middle Earth on a specific date? Surely the Terminal is not the best place to go to find out such information? Well, that’s probably true, but it is able to provide some help with these tasks - and you can practice the useful cat and less commands at the same time. Try the following in your Terminal:

cat /usr/share/calendar/calendar.lotr | less

This will output a calendar of hobbity events to the terminal thanks to cat and provide handy scrolling navigation courtesy of the less after the pipe. If you wanted to filter the results by, say, a particular character then grep is useful - and it is fairly common knowledge that hobbits and wizards like pipes:

cat /usr/share/calendar/calendar.lotr | grep Frodo

cat /usr/share/calendar/calendar.lotr | grep Gandalf

There are lots of other calendars to explore: if you cd /usr/share/calendar/ and then run ls you will see a list of calendar files. Simply add one of these filenames to the end of cat /usr/share/calendar/ and you will see the contents of the file in the Terminal (remembering to add a pipe and less if you want scrolling).

You can also use grep to search calendars for particular dates in the format MM/DD:

cat /usr/share/calendar/calendar.birthday | grep 12/10

cat /usr/share/calendar/calendar.history | grep 03/30

Of course, you can also pipe in say , although it doesn’t handle the dates very well:

cat /usr/share/calendar/calendar.computer | grep Apple | say
3. Take the weather with you
Curl is a non-interactive web browser which can ‘pull information from the internet and display it in your terminal’. Ensure your Terminal window is full-sized (for best results) and input the following command:

curl [http://wttr.in/](http://wttr.in/)

You will see a weather forecast in your Terminal, replete with stunning graphics! If, for some reason, you wanted to preserve this as an offline version, you can do while practising the > command:

curl [http://wttr.in/](http://wttr.in//) > weather

Now you can shut off the internet and simply type cat weather to bring back the forecast.

When back online, if you wanted to open the webpage from your Terminal into your browser, just type the following:

open [http://wttr.in/](http://wttr.in/)

It doesn’t quite have the same charm when viewed in a browser, but the open command is certainly a handy shortcut to know:

open [https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)

Do take a look at man curl and man open for more options when using these commands.
4. A star-spangled banner
The following command won’t really get you a star-spangled banner, it produces more of a #-spangled banner (pound-spangled? hash-spangled?):

banner -w 50 Hello, world!

The -w switch and su...

---Fun Mac Terminal Commands. A lot more | by Allen Xiang | Medium
Excerpt

A lot more
---A Talking Terminal
Your terminal can talks. Just use the command, say , and whatever follows will be spoken out.

say what is grief, if not love persevering

For example, I like to add it to my bash_profile. Every time I open a new tab, my terminal greets me.

You can choose different voices. For example, this is Amelie’s voice

say -v Amelie Bonjour, je m’appelle Amelie. Je suis une voix canadienne.

To list all available voices, do: say -v "?"
Play Sounds
Have you ever wondered how to make a sound from the terminal? The OS system does have the naive sound clips saved in AIFF files. To play them, simply do:

afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff

Bonus, you can add a sound to the end of your code. It’s always nice to be notified when your program ends. For example, in python one can do:

os.system('afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff')
os.system("""
osascript -e 'display notification "Message" with title "Title"'
""")

The second line will display a notification on your mac in addition to play a sound. Here the osascript is simply a command to execute AppleScript (more on automation workflow on Mac).
Watch a Star War Movie
To watch Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope in ASCII art, do:

nc towel.blinkenlights.nl 23

Note, for macOS version earlier than Sierra, do: telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
Play Games in Emacs
Taking a break? Let’s play a game. Emacs GNU in Mac support some simple games. The steps are:

Type emacs and press return
Press ESC , and then **x**
Enter the name of the game. For example, tetris

The list of some games in emacs are (all lower cases):
5x5 , blackbox , solitaire , adventure , gomoku , life , snake , tetris

To switch to a different game, do step 2, and enter a new game name. My personal favorite is the psychotherapist. In case you’re depressed, talk a psychotherapist is easy in emacs — just enter doctor , and enjoy the conversion.
Create Banners or ASCII Arts
The banner command allows you to create ASCII character string in large letter. For example, try the following commands:

banner -w 30 One Piece

Note, the banner is horizontally displayed in Linux, while in MacOS, it’s vertically displayed. If you really want a horizontal banner (ex. pretty comment in code), try figlet , which is available in Homebrew.

brew install figlet

Some websites offer nice ASCII arts. For example:

curl artscene.textfiles.com/asciiart/dragon.txt
Weather Report
Without open your browser, you can display three-days of forecast via:

curl http://wttr.in/

Alternatively, you can view the moon’s phase via curl [wttr.in/](http://wttr.in/)moon .
The Day in History
Your system information is saved on your mac. When in doubt, just ask terminal for the answers to your historical exams:

Learn famous birthdays on a specific date:
cat /usr/share/calendar/calendar.birthday | grep 03/14# Learn historical events on a specific date:
cat /usr/share/calendar/calendar.history | grep 06/15# Learn a musical event on a specific date
cat /usr/share/calendar/calendar.music | grep 10/09

How to open a file

vim my-file.text

This simple command in MACOS terminal for instance will open the file “my-file.text” in the terminal itself (to avoid opening external code/text editing software like Vscode or sublime) and will allow us to quickly edit our code

How to start edit

Click the letter “i”, once we did you’ll see at the bottom the word “ — — INSERT — — ” and from this point on we can edit the code since we change the mode from “command mode” (default) to “insert mode”.

How to save and quit

In command mode write

:wq

Then enter to execute “write & quit” the file.
Workflow of commands
Let’s go through a flow of work with VIM just to make sure we get the right idea how to edit files. In this flow we’ll create a readme file which is common for many open source projects. We are going to open the project, edit the project then save the changes we apply and check that the changes are saved.

Open file with VIM

In the command line (iterm for example) let’s write the next command to create our README.md file than we’ll edit the file.

echo “My First Project” >> README.md

Open the file in VIM

vim file-name.text

At this point the file is read only, and we need to open “insert mode” to apply changes.

Edit file

Click “i” in your keyboard

Apply changes to the file, in our case fix “First” to “First”. Once you are done, go to the next step (i’d recommend you to edit the file through different commands to practice from the bottom cheat sheet).

Exit the insert mode

Press “ESC” button to exist back to read only mode

Save changes

Press “:” to start and write commands, then to write “w” (see below full command).

:w

Then press enter to submit the changes.

Check that our changes apply

We’ll use the command cat just to read the file and look into it. We can also use “vim” command to get to read only mode then press “:q” (without the quotes) to exist the file without applying changes.

cat README.md

Or

vim README.md

Summary

We know a few commands, we’ve done one flow of work. In the next section we’ll see a cheatsheet of vim commands so we could work with files faster.

## 2022-01-13T15:31:14.873Z - Entry II

There’s an old saying
That which doesn’t kill you makes you stronger
I don’t believe that, I think the things that try to kill you,
Make you angry and sad.

## 2022-01-15T05:51:56.396Z - Automated Backups and/or API Support?

I was thinking of incorporating external data into my Day One journals via API but surprisingly it doesn't look like one exists (???). There is an official cli tool but it doesn't look like it allows you to read/search previous entries. Without an API it would be difficult to maintain journal/entry states so I guess I could backup to JSON but is there a way to do that automatically or does it require a manual export every time?

## 2022-01-16T18:02:13.054Z - Hello, Markdown

Markdown is a popular format for writing documents, aims to achieve common formats using simple syntax.

Instead of explaining everything, which makes beginners scared, this doc wanted to show you commonly used features in 5 minutes.
Heading level 1
Heading level 2
Heading level 3
As you can see, headings start with # sign, from level 1 to level 6.
Text Formats
Standard Markdown supports Bold and Italic text, some implementations support strikethrough. We need to embed HTML for underline text, such as <u> this </u> .
Lists
Use numbers and minus sign for ordered list and unordered list:

First
Second

Taio
JSBox

Also, Taio supports checklists like this:

Unchecked
Checked
Links and Images
Links are supported by adding brackets like this:

Taio Website

Images are similar, just add an exclamation mark before it.
Preview
Markdown can be previewed as HTML, please try it out by tapping the "eye" button.
More Syntaxes
Above syntaxes are sufficient enough for daily use, you can learn more when needed.

Besides, Taio provides a toolbar that lets you use above features easily.

Give it a try!

Feel free to edit this file, you can always find an online version here.

## 2022-01-27T16:41:55.396Z - Growing Pains

Long days and long nights,
A million ways to fail
But this time I'mma get it right

Been down, counted out
Left for dead
I won't feel sorry for myself

Body pains and headaches
Got nothing on heartbreak
Breathe in and breathe out
Listen as I sing out loud

Hit the reset
and I don't know
where I'm going
Too much time
in my mind
and I know it
I can't move forward
without you letting go and
If you care
that isn't fair
please never show it

I'm falling apart
this shit is so hard
Got a broken heart
Left it in your yard
Drove to the bar
Just to crash my car
So I can restart
Anywhere you aren’t

I'm falling apart
this shit is so hard
Got a broken heart
Left it in your yard
Drove to the bar
Just to crash my car
So I can restart
Anywhere you aren’t

What doesn't kill you makes you still alive
What doesn't love you makes you dead inside
What doesn't miss you isn't worth your time
What doesn't help you isn't good for your life

Hey I know right now that you're feeling sad
But everything is dark when you look in the past
There's a reason why some things they do not last
Please do not let those things be what we hold you back

Now I can begin
To live again
With no more stress
Cause This is the end
We can't be friends
It won't make sense
In my defense
We were never meant

Long days and long nights,
A million ways to fail
But this time I'mma get it right

Been down, counted out
Left for dead
I won't feel sorry for myself

Body pains and headaches
Got nothing on heartbreak
Breathe in and breathe out
Listen as I sing out loud

Hey I know right now that you're feeling sad
But everything is dark when you're looking in the past
There's a reason why some things don't last
Please Don't let those thing hold you back

What doesn't kill you makes you still alive
What doesn't love you makes you dead inside
What doesn't miss you never says goodbye
What doesn't help you tends to run and hide

And when things get hard you can't just run and hide
You can't just let it eat you up on the inside
Or it will consume you and your life will pass on by

Keep your head up cause you are enough

## 2022-01-27T16:46:03.461Z - I Can’t Stay Here

Somewhere deep within me (yea) I know
There's a fire burning in my soul
It's what drives me the most

Some days it's hard to see my self worth
Depression got me hostage in a hearse
Been that way since birth, am I cursed?

I can't stay here, stay here
Trapped inside my worst fears
The darkness is trying
To make all my light disappear

And I don't want to be here, be here. Oh no

I can't stay here, stay here
Trapped inside my worst fears
The darkness is trying
To make all my light disappear

And I don't want to be here, be here. Oh no

Somewhere deep within me (yea) I hold
The key to let all of my fears go
And stop giving them control

I just need to light the way back home
Even if it means being alone
I need to be on my own

I can't stay here, stay here
I'm getting rid of my fears
The darkness, it won't take me
When my light reappears

I will find my light
I'll take back my life
I will be your guide
When you get lost inside

I can't stay here, stay here
I'm getting rid of my fears
The darkness, it won't take me
When my light reappears

I will find my light
I'll take back my life
I will be your guide
When you get lost inside

There is a light
I can see it my sights
I know the darkness
Isn’t very far behind

I can feel the dark
As it's aiming for my heart

## 2022-01-27T17:01:18.746Z - Into The Darkness

For so long I’ve been lost inside my mind
All I see is darkness, almost like I’m blind

Thoughts on rewind
Replay all the time
And I cannot find
A switch for the lights
Feel lost every night
Am I still alive
I question why

I question why

## 2022-01-27T17:08:35.565Z - Light Absorption

I think see a light up in front of me
Could it be from me, am I glowing? Am I glowing?
I find it hard to believe that I'm worth anything more than nothing, oh no

And lately I've been feeling all this weight up in my brain
And I need to get away but I can't ever get away
And I just know that I'm struggling
Yeah I'm struggling
I need to move on with my life cuz it's crumbling

Everyday is just the same
And I've been trying to get away
But I can't ever get away
Cause nothing ever seems to change
And Im tired of the chase
I need a change of pace and a break from the heartache

And I don't know where I'm supposed to go
Now that I am on my own
Can somebody guide me in the right direction?

It's time to let the light absorb me
So I can see through the darkness in me
I know I can be the light, I just need some time
It's time to let the light absorb me
So I can see through the darkness in me
I know I can be the light, I just need some time

And lately I've been feeling all this weight up in my brain
And I need to get away but I can't ever get away
And I just know that I'm struggling
Yeah I'm struggling
I need to move on with my life cuz it's crumbling

Everyday is just the same
And I've been trying to get away
But I can't ever get away
Cause nothing ever seems to change
And Im tired of the chase
I need a change of pace and a break from the heartache

## 2022-01-27T17:14:22.400Z - Hate Me

Sitting all alone inside this room
and I don't know what I should do,
cause I just hate everything I'm around lately.
Wish that I could do the things I used to do,
like way back when I never knew you,
now all you ever do is hate me

So fucking hate me all that you want
you fucking played me or so you thought
I gave you my heart and all that I got
you just mad cuz you got yourself caught
So fucking hate me all that you want
you fucking played me or so you thought
I gave you my heart and all that I got
you just mad cuz you got yourself caught

Have you ever lost yourself to somebody you love?
Have you ever felt like you were never enough?
Have you ever been so down staring at that bottle tryna drown?
That was my life then, this is my life now

Cause you see, eventually
you gotta pick up all the pieces
Of who you used to be
And put it yourself back together
So you can be better than ever
And I ain't gonna lie
It's gonna take some time
To get yourself back into that right mind
But I promise if you try and try
Everything's gonna be alright

Just take my hand and I'll show you how to get there
I'll light the dark so there's no reason to be scared
Don't give up, don't give up on me now
I will lead you out, I promise

## 2022-02-01T16:14:40.830Z - I Had a Dream about You

I always wake up sad after them.
I’m always chasing after you, begging for you to love me the same way you use to beg me to love you, but I never stopped loving you. Not once, not for a second and even after all these years later I still love you. The same as I did the first night I met you. You still haunt me, long after you’re gone.

## 2022-02-02T01:09:15.851Z - Betrayer

I’ve been such a sad soul, I know.

Every days been a waste, I'm losing hope

Every night I'm locked in this room alone

Don't know where to go, don't know where to go

The most pathetic state of sadness
Lost reality to madness,
I'm as empty as this mattress,
just give me some fucking matches,
I'll turn this place into ashes
Flip the world up on it's axis,

I see my life as it flashes,
how long until this passes
As they place me in the casket,
I hope one day you regret
or maybe you'll just forget
All the things that I once meant
All the time that we spent
All the things I once did
All the bullshit you said
All the lies that you hid

somebody who is heartless and couldn't care any less

I’ve become so bitter, so cold

My heart is now made of snow

Every beat pumps out an icy flow

Until everything around me is froze

Been trying for months now to let you go

You buried me alive six feet down below

All I am now is a dim glow casting shadows

A hollow shell with no place I can call home

I’ve lost so much I’ve got nothing to show

I worked so hard to build everything you stole

## 2022-02-02T01:09:51.506Z - Dear God, I Think I've Had Enough

this planet is doomed I'm giving up
I'm sorry but there's no one that I can trust
and lately I find myself not caring
and not giving a fuck

maybe it's just me
and I've gone crazy
I scream and shout
but you don't ever hear me now

maybe I'm just changing
into somebody
that I'm already hating
my life is yours for the taking
oh please God I'm tired of waiting

I pray that you'll save me
I pray that you hear me
I pray till I fall asleep
why aren't you listening

I guess maybe it's true what they say
that you lost hope and walked away

I guess maybe there is no hope
and there's only one other thing I know
that can take me where I want to go
walking through the shadows at night all alone

Hey REAP
can you hear me?
I can't sleep
I'm in too deep
and I think
maybe if I sink
I can bring you hear with me

of somebody that won't leave

I'm on my own
and there's only one thing I know
that can save me from this hell
death can you hear me as I call out

hating all this waiting
starting to phase me

## 2022-02-02T01:12:45.590Z - I Don't Know where to Go

all I know is that I'm losing control of my soul
and I don't want to lose myself anymore to you

All this time that I spent
wondering where you have been
I wasted all my time
just to watch you give yourself to someone else
yeah I know that I'm not perfect
but I had given everything I could to you and look what you did
yeah you took my heart
pulled it straight out of my chest
and I don't know where to fucking go
I'm honestly broken
and I can't be saved
words left on replay
they're cutting right through me now

And some days
I don't know what I'm to believe
cuz everything you told me is exactly what I wanted to hear from you
when you open your mouth
you drown me out

But this isn't anything new,
anything new oh no
all these nights alone
feeling so low
so cold waiting by the phone
but you don't ever answer me no, no

And I wish that I could take all my time back,
wish that you hadn't ended things like that, things like that.
All these days are the same
and I just try to get away
but she just stay the same and
I don't want to go back now
I don't want to go back
just leave me here to die this time

These days I don't know what to believe
you tell me that I still mean nothing
I don't believe that it's true
I just think what you're going through
is something you can't handle
you don't need me there
but you say I don't matter
cuz it ain't even fair
all this time I've tried
just to get you out my mind

What's the word mean
when you say "forever" to me?
Yeah was it all worth it was he worth it cuz you got me feeling so damn
worthless
Yea oh feeling so alone
got my heart turning cold
and I'm feeling so cold
turn my heart into stone
you know I don't deserve this

## 2022-02-13T16:24:31.993Z - A Revision To Dr. Jekyll's Hangover

Two pills a day to completely change everything.
For better and for worse.
Remapping neurons and elevating heart-rate.
Pushing you to move in a single focused direction.
Not always the direction you should be focusing on.
Going from normal to all time highs.
Ending in all time lows until it’s time for another dose.
Day in. Day out.
It’s never enough.
Begin. End. Repeat.

What have I become?

Who could I have been without this?

A single dose creates an illusion of a better you,

A second dose creates a belief that you have can’t be you without it.

You become a slave to a tiny pill made of chemical compounds that work against you, not for you.

By the time you realize that you are a slave to it, it doesn’t matter.

Just take another dose and forget about the reality of the situation.

A reality that always comes back once the dose's life cycle ends.

Which means that it’s time for another dose.

Unlike Nikki, you will die a slave.

As a kid, I would sometimes go out in the
Backyard at night and just lay back and
Look at the stars. In Montana in the Summer sometimes you can see the Milky Way all the way across the sky and sometimes I would just lay back and try and feel the earth rotating under me.
I Never did, but every time even though that was so fun and I was so awestruck.

Part of me was always a little sad
during those times because I really at
my core I wanted to know about those
places and I know I would never be able
to reach any of them in my lifetime.

So, flash forward a couple of dozen years and
now I am an astrophysicist, I get paid cash money to understand things like dark matter and galaxies and my specialty is supermassive black holes, Which is so cool, so what I want to tell
you about today is the greatest most profound discovery of our generation.

I think of it like when humanity discovered that the world was round. We just did it because we wanted to know about the world in which we lived and yet that knowledge changed navigation, which changed the way in which we could ship
goods and ideas and people around the world
And so for better or worse, our world was
transformed forever.

This is that kind of paradigm-shifting
discovery that I want to talk with you about today.

Okay, all right, are you ready?
That was it, that was humanity's first
detection of a gravitational wave. I just have to confess that when I heard this and saw that waveform, the little wiggle on the bottom, I cried. People around me cried. There was a fashion designer so inspired by the shape of that waveform, that the next day, she made a dress.

So I just have to confess off script now, that this is the “it dressed among lady Astrophysicist” so when I said that I was Giving a ted talk to some of my friends They were like cool and I said um but
I'm gonna wear the dress and I knew had To say what dress and then there were Squeals wow that somebody came down the Hall to check and see that we were not Hurt so clearly we're a little excited About this event but I've been talking I
don't see anybody crying or squealing so I think I need to do a better job of Explaining why this is such a cool Amazing profound deal and this is going To require me teaching a little bit of General relativity so yay it's going to be Fine it's not painful you'll make it It's built character right so okay I'm Going to get serious here the universe
Itself is three dimensions of space in
One of time that's space-time and that
Actually is the universe and i
Personally can't see four dimensions
Very well and so we always make an
Analogy of a giant fabric and so this
Fabric is space-time and that is the
The universe as you can imagine the universe
Is being this giant sheet and general
Relativity says that matter like the sun
And the earth matter Bends space-time so massive objects like The sun well they've been space-time a Lot and low mass objects a little where Mass objects like the earth make smaller
Dimples in space-time kind of like in That picture and remember in that Picture it just looks like space is Bending but remember that's a spacetime Tucked together so it's really space and Time that is stretching and so what Gravity is at its core it's just theResponse of moving matter to all those Dimples in the universe and in this
Picture black holes which are the thing I work in are just matter that's so Compact that they make a very sharp bend In space-time and a very deep bend in Space-time okay got that next step
Matter moves right so moving matter in
The universe makes a moving wave in the
Universe kind of like that picture back
There and so moving matter makes a wave
A gravitational wave and it's kind of
Like an electromagnetic wave in other
Words light in that little wave both of
Them travel at the speed of light and
Both of them carry energy but light
Moves through the universe and is
Blocked by things like this room but
Gravitational waves are the universe so
When you get a wave it is a wave in
Space-time itself we are in space-time
So if a gravitational wave passes us by
We're going along with it we're waving
To because we are a part of the universe
And I personally think that's super
Profound so sometimes I just sit with
That idea and imagine that in this room
Right now we are bathed with
Gravitational waves from every bit of
Moving matter in the universe stretching
And squeezing us slowing time down
For us and speeding it up, I can't feel
It probably you don't feel it and the
The reason why is that this effect is minute
Infinitesimal change in space-time for
Us let me just paint that picture but
It's so hard I kept practicing things
That would make sense as an analogy and
The best one that I've heard is that
Okay the amount of change in space-time
That we usually feel is one part and ten
To the minus twenty one that's a big
Number and so how to conceptualize that
...

It's like this,

Every time human beings look at the universe in a different way,

Like, if we look in a different wavelength of light or when we look through a microscope for the first time,

We discover something very different about our Universe.

Every time, that changes our perspective of the Universe.

And now we're going to get another change

Remember, you are matter.

You move.

All throughout your life you make a Gravitational-Wave.

Every move,

Every choice you make all throughout your life,

Is making a Gravitational-Wave

Propagating away from you at the speed of light and long after you're gone,

That imprint that you have made in The Universe will exist.

And when I held my two kids for the first time That's written on space-time too.

Sorry

So I just want to end with the idea that your choices matter.

They're going to be part of the universe

And the things that we do now are going to be traveling away from us,

As a wave in the Cosmos at the speed of light, eventually reaching those very stars that I was looking at when I was a little girl .

So remember,

Your choices matter and they're written in The Universe

## 2022-02-13T23:11:13.881Z - The Spacetime Symphony of Gravitational Waves

A couple years ago I created a set of fictional characters for a concept album I was writing, it’s basically a soundtrack for an epic symphony and orchestra, with an outer space theme.

The story is based off its main character “Astronaudia” whose real name is Naudia Lightbringer.

Naudia is an Astrophysicist who follows in the foot steps of her missing father. She discovers the last project her father was working on before he disappeared was an advanced spacecraft that can travel to multiple Universes.

While developing both the character and the album I came across a TED talk by Kelly Holley-Bockelmann called “The Spacetime Symphony of Gravitational Waves” that inspired me to create more of what I now call “The Naudia Project”

I composed a score based off “The Spacetime Symphony of Gravitational Waves” and it shares the same title as this TED talk as well.

I used my favorite parts of Kelley’s talk in the song as well.

I have posted the song and transcript below.

50 space terms for understanding the universe

Oct. 1, 2020, marks the 62nd birthday of the National Aeronautics and Space Agency, or NASA. The agency was founded in 1958, the same year President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act and one year after the Soviets launched Sputnik 1, the world’s first artificial satellite. NASA was designed from the start to push the bounds of space exploration with research into aerospace and aeronautics as well as with a civilian space program.

From putting footprints on the moon in 1969, to launching satellites into space in 1972 to take images of the Earth’s surface, to a proposed 2020 mission to gather samples from Mars, NASA continues to expand our understanding of the vastness of space and change the way we perceive our solar system (and all that lays beyond it). NASA has gathered unimaginable footage, created first-hand accounts of space, and fostered cutting-edge research. Through the creation of new technologies and procedures, NASA created a foundation of ideas that were previously only theories.

As the agency unrelentingly forged a path toward astronomical discovery, NASA also invented a number of technologies that we use in our everyday lives. These include artificial limbs, LASIK surgery, improved water filtration, camera phones, freeze-dried foods, memory foam, LED lights, and even the Dust Buster. In fact, it was a NASA scientist who invented the Super Soaker squirt gun. In honor of NASA’s birthday, Stacker has compiled a list of key astronomy and astrophysics terms from a variety of authoritative science communication sources, including Crash Course: Astronomy, How Stuff Works, and International Comet Quarterly. Keep reading to learn the terms that are commonly used in this fascinating field.

#1. Aberration of light

Similar to how raindrops hit a moving car window as if from an angle, an aberration of light is the phenomenon where stars or other celestial bodies appear from Earth to be slightly off from their true position. This happens because of motion—specifically, the interaction of the Earth’s movement with the speed of light causes this confusing phenomenon.

[Pictured: The bright vertical line and the other rays with barred lines are aberrations caused by the bright flash of the solar flare in a sunspot, 2017.]

#2. Alpha Centauri

Alpha Centauri is the name of the closest star system to earth. It comprises two main stars, Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B, as well as the closest of the three stars, Proxima Centauri. In 2016, astronomers found an Earth-sized planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, later named Proxima b. While this planet shows signs that life could exist, astronomers are still unsure how habitable it is.

#3. Andromeda Galaxy

Also known as M31, this galaxy is the closest to the Milky Way, where the Earth exists. Andromeda Galaxy has a similar structure to the Milky Way; it is spiral in shape and has a large density of stars, dust, and gas. Because of its proximity, it is the only galaxy that can be seen from Earth with the unaided eye, particularly on fall and winter nights.

#4. Asteroid

Asteroids are chunks of rock or metal that used to be parts of other small planets that have broken off due to a collision in space and now orbit the sun. The name asteroid means “star-like.” referring to their emission of light. Asteroids can be lumped into orbital groupings called families and form into an asteroid belt.

#5. Barycenter

A barycenter is the common center mass around which a solar system orbits. While it has become common knowledge that planets orbit stars, it is, in fact, the barycenter that both stars and planets orbit around. Our solar system’s barycenter is constantly changing position based on where each of the planets is in its orbit, ranging from being near the center of the sun to being just outside its surface.

## 2022-02-16T02:44:05.756Z - Glossary of Terms For Science Fiction

Advanced Technology.

Often, science fiction universes have technologies that are beyond what humans are capable of doing at the present, such as the iPad-like devices used in mid-nighties science fiction shows. And, most will have technologies that are actually impossible to create. This is how you introduce magic into your world without calling it magic.

AI Artificial Intelligence.

These are human-created intelligent beings that live in a virtual environment such as on a computer. Hal from 2001 is iconic in this regard.

Alien.

A creature not from Earth. Or at least not from where your protagonist is from. Writing TIP: Aliens that look and act human are easy to relate to. This is why the vast majority of aliens we see on the screen look like humans with minor facial prosthetics. Think pointy ears or blue skin.

Android

from the Greek meaning like a human. These are artificial life forms that are constructed to resemble a human and act like one. They can be made from any material even organic material like flesh. Not to be confused with a Golem, which is a magical equivalent.

Beaming Technology.

Beaming technology fires a high energy beam of light in a straight line from point A to point B. It can be used as a weapon like a phaser or it can be used to transport matter, like a teleporter.

Black Hole.

In reality this is a point in space where matter is so dense it sucks in even light particles, and eventually they evaporate. In Science Fiction black holes are magical places that your characters can travel through to another dimension or go back in time from. They are indeed a plot convenience that moves the story on. Writing TIP: Black holes let your reader know something dangerous is about to happen. Use them to build tension or to create a plot twist.

Butlerian Jihad.

Used by Frank Herbert in Dune, this Jihad is a revolution where humans take back their freedom from artificial intelligence. Writing TIP: Humans in this universe will have a distrust of technology. People will be good at remembering things and doing complex calculations in their heads as they will not trust a computer for anything.

Clones.

You can create a copy of any living being. Sometimes, they have all the memories of the original or they can be given the memories of the original. This is how you bring a character back from the dead without magic.

Colony World.

Science Fiction is obsessed with spreading human civilisation throughout the galaxy. Just as often these colony border planets are destroyed by a mysterious force that your hero needs to investigate.

Credits.

Your protagonist will need money. Why not use the most common science fiction term of all and have them spend credits at the local cantina.

Cryo-Ship.

A star ship where the majority or all of the human crew is frozen in suspended animation so that they do not age during the journey.

Cybernetic Revolt.

A revolution where robots take over the world from humans.

Cyborg.

These are part-organic, part-synthetic humanoid constructs. Famously, the Borg from Star Trek fall loosely into this category.

Deep Space.

This is the wild west of space. You might make friends with the aliens here or just as easily go to war with them.

Federation of Planets.

A loose coalition of star systems in an alliance similar to the NATO or the UN.

Force Fields, Energy Shields.

In case your societies advanced morality isn’t enough to protect them, they will need a force field. These will protect your ships and some people will even have personal ones. This makes melee combat possible when your fancy space gun can’t get through the evil aliens shield. Surprisingly, swords always go through shields. Shields on star ships are measured in percentages.

FTL.

Faster Than Light. Used to refer to fictional ships that can travel beyond the speed of light.

Galactic.

One galaxy.

Generation Ship.

A star ship where generations of humans live and die as they move between worlds. They are huge and have large populations and spacious living quarters.

Gigantic Death Rays, Super Weapons.

In the more fanciful science fiction (From Flash Gordon to Star Wars) where the fiction is in capital letters, there is always a super weapon. These are almost always red or green laser beams that destroy planets.

Hyper Space.

A way to travel quickly between two points in space by passing through another dimension – usually subspace.

Intergalactic.

Between galaxies.

Inter-Planetary.

Between planets.

Interstellar.

Between stars.

Methuselah Ship.

A star ship piloted by long-lived or immortal humans. They may only have a handful of occupants.

Nova Bombs, Star Busters.

These are nukes that can destroy a solar system.

Null Space, Z-Space, Final Space, The Warp.

A dimension between normal space and other dimensions where the rules of the universe don’t apply. This is where you can find, or avoid, mind-destro...

---
Angular Size and Distance
The apparent size of an object in the sky, or the distance between two objects, measured as an angle. Your index finger held at arm’s length spans about 1°, your fist about 10°.

Aperture
The diameter of a telescope’s main lens or mirror — and the scope’s most important attribute. As a rule of thumb, a telescope’s maximum useful magnification is 50 times its aperture in inches (or twice its aperture in millimeters).

Asterism
Any prominent star pattern that isn’t a whole constellation, such as the Northern Cross or the Big Dipper.

Asteroid (Minor Planet)
A solid body orbiting the Sun that consists of metal and rock. Most are only a few miles in diameter and are found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, too small and far away to be seen easily in a small telescope. A few venture closer to the Sun and cross Earth’s orbit.

Astronomical Unit
The average distance from Earth to the Sun, slightly less than 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).

Averted Vision
Viewing an object by looking slightly to its side. This technique can help you detect faint objects that are invisible when you stare directly at them.
---
Baily's Beads
A few "beads" of sunlight, shining between mountain peaks and through the valleys along the Moon's edge in the moment before totality.

Barlow Lens
A lens that’s placed into the focusing tube to effectively double or triple a telescope’s focal length and, in turn, the magnification of any eyepiece used with it.

Black Hole
A concentration of mass so dense that nothing — not even light — can escape its gravitational pull once swallowed up. Many galaxies (including ours) have supermassive black holes at their centers. Want to know more? Check out our FREE ebook on black holes.

Blue Moon
Traditionally, something that happens rarely or never. More recently, this has come to mean the second full Moon in a single calendar month.
------
Celestial Coordinates
A grid system for locating things in the sky. It’s anchored to the celestial poles (directly above Earth’s north and south poles) and the celestial equator (directly above Earth’s equator). Declination and right ascension are the celestial equivalents of latitude and longitude.

Circumpolar
Denotes an object near a celestial pole that never dips below the horizon as Earth rotates and thus does not rise or set.

Collimation
Aligning the optical elements of a telescope so that they all point in the proper direction. Most reflectors and compound telescopes require occasional collimation in order to produce the best possible images.

Comet
A comet is a “dirty snowball” of ice and rocky debris, typically a few miles across, that orbits the Sun in a long ellipse. When close to the Sun, the warmth evaporates the ice in the nucleus to form a coma (cloud of gas) and a tail. Named for their discoverers, comets sometimes make return visits after as little as a few years or as long as tens of thousands of years.

Compound Telescope
A telescope with a mirror in the back and a lens in the front. The most popular designs are the Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope (SCT) and the Maksutov-Cassegrain telescope (commonly called a “Mak”).

Conjunction
When the Moon or a planet appears especially close either to another planet or to a bright star.

Constellation
A distinctive pattern of stars used informally to organize a part of the sky. There are 88 official constellations, which technically define sections of the sky rather than collections of specific stars. Find a list of all 88 constellation names here.

Culmination
The moment when a celestial object crosses the meridian and is thus at its highest above the horizon.
---
Dark Adaptation
The eyes’ transition to night vision, in order to see faint objects. Dark adaptation is rapid during the first 5 or 10 minutes after you leave a well-lit room, but full adaptation requires at least a half hour — and it can be ruined by a momentary glance at a bright light.

Declination (Dec.)
The celestial equivalent of latitude, denoting how far (in degrees) an object in the sky lies north or south of the celestial equator.

Dobsonian (“Dob”)
A type of Newtonian reflector, made popular by amateur astronomer John Dobson, that uses a simple but highly effective wooden mount. Dobs provide more aperture per dollar than any other telescope design.

Double Star (Binary Star)
Two stars that lie very close to, and are often orbiting, each other. Line-of-sight doubles are a consequence of perspective and aren’t physically related. Many stars are multiples (doubles, triples, or more) gravitationally bound together. Usually such stars orbit so closely that they appear as a single point of light even when viewed through professional telescopes.
---
Earthshine
Sunlight reflected by Earth that makes the otherwise dark part of the Moon glow faintly. It’s especially obvious during...

Antimatter Antimatter is made up of tiny particles that are the opposite of normal material. When matter meets its antimatter equal they are both destroyed, releasing lots of energy.

Asteroid Asteroids are chunks of rock and metal left over from when our Solar System formed. Most can be found between Mars and Jupiter, a region of space we call the Asteroid Belt.

Asteroid Belt The asteroid belt is a region of our Solar System between Mars and Jupiter. It is heavily populated by asteroids and dwarf planets.

Astronomical Unit An astronomical unit is the average distance between the centre of the Earth and the centre of the Sun (about 150 million kilometres).

Atmosphere An atmosphere is a layer of gases surrounding a planet or a moon. Earth’s atmosphere contains the oxygen we breathe.

Atoms Atoms are the building blocks of the Universe. All matter is made of these tiny particles. Your body contains billions and billions of atoms!

Big Bang Around 14 billion years ago the entire Universe was inside a bubble thousands of times smaller than a pinhead. Then it exploded and the Universe was born.

Billion A billion is a thousand million (1000, 000, 000).

Binary System Four out of every five points of light we see in the night sky are not one star, but two or more orbiting around each other. We call a system of two stars a binary system.

Black Dwarf A black dwarf is the very last phase in the lifecycle of a star like our Sun. When the star has cooled down so much that it no longer shines at all it becomes a black dwarf.

Black Hole Black holes form when a massive star dies and is squashed down into an incredibly tiny space. Black holes' very strong gravity can even swallow-up light if it gets too close.

Blazar A blazar is a galaxy with an active supermassive black hole at its centre. The black hole can rip material into tiny pieces that are then blasted cannon into space.

Bow shocks An effect that happens everywhere in the Universe, similar to bow waves caused by boats cutting through the water

Brown Dwarf Brown dwarfs are called “failed stars” by some astronomers. Unlike stars, they never become hot enough to start giving off energy in a process called ‘nuclear fusion’.

Comet Comets are made of ice, dust and rock, so they are sometimes called “dirty snowballs”. They come from the outer regions of the Solar System and travel around the Sun, like planets.

Corona The corona is an envelope of blisteringly hot gas surrounding the Sun.

Cosmic Dust Cosmic dust is made up of tiny solid particles in space, sometimes called stardust. You could fit dozens of these particles onto a pinhead.

Dark Energy Dark energy is the main ingredient of the Universe (roughly 68%). Little is known about it, except that it opposes gravity, causing galaxies to fly apart from each other faster.

Dark Matter Dark matter is a mysterious, invisible particle, 5 times more common than normal material. We think its gravity's needed to hold normal material together in galaxies!

Dark Nebulae Dark nebulae look like holes in the night sky, they are completely black. However, they aren’t empty; dark nebulae are thick clouds of cosmic gas and dust that block out light.

Density Density is a measurement of how much material an object has. For example, a balloon and a bowling ball could be the same size, but the bowling ball has a higher density.

Diameter Diameter is a measurement of the distance across the widest part of a circle or sphere. For example, the diameter of Earth is 12,700 kilometers.

Dwarf Galaxy Dwarf galaxies are much smaller than normal galaxies. They are made up of just a few billion stars rather than hundreds of billions.

Dwarf Planet A dwarf planet is an object in the Solar System that is bigger than a comet or asteroid but smaller than a planet. Our Solar System has five dwarf planets, including Pluto.

Earth Earth is our beautiful home planet; the only place in the Universe where life exists (that we know of)!

Elements There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other. Examples of elements are Oxygen, Iron and Gold.

Elliptical Galaxy There are three types of galaxy which all have different shapes. Elliptical galaxies are shaped like rugby balls. These are old galaxies with no new stars forming.

Emission Nebulae Emission nebulae are clouds of cosmic gas and dust that have been heated by nearby stars. As the clouds cool down they begin to shine (the same way a neon light works).

Exo-planet An extrasolar planet (exo-planet for short) is a planet that orbits a star beyond our Solar System.

Force A force is a push or pull on an object. Examples of forces are friction and gravity.

Galactic Bulge In a spiral galaxy the bulge is a spherical-shaped area at the centre of the galaxy. The bulge is made up of old stars as well as cosmic gas and dust.

Galactic Disc Spiral galaxies are disc shaped, like a CD with the bulge at the centre....

## 2022-02-18T11:12:16.194Z - Using IFTTT with Day One

IFTTT is a great way to automate some aspects of your journal entries with Day One. Use IFTTT to import data from Facebook, Twitter, more!

What is it?

If you’re not familiar with IFTTT (If This Then That), it’s a free web-based service that allows users to create chains of simple conditional statements, called “applets”, which are triggered based on changes to other web services. IFTTT is a great way to automatically add content from many web services including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and more. You can even set up an SMS trigger to create a journal entry via text message!

Get started

IFTTT requires Day One Sync. Day One Sync is available to all Plus (grandfathered) and Premium users.

You will create a free account at IFTTT.com. Then you can begin creating "applets". These are the services you can connect that will automatically create entries based on the criteria you choose. You can have entries created in Day One every time you send a tweet, or post a new Facebook status. You can send an email to IFTTT that will create entries in Day One.

Once you sign up for an account, click My Applets to get started. Many recommendations will be available. Once you have chosen a desired "trigger" you will need to connect your Day One Sync account. If you use Apple ID to sign in to Day One Sync, please be sure to use the link to Authenticate with Apple ID.

Connect here: https://ifttt.com/day_one/

Note: We currently limit up to 100 entries created per day via IFTTT.

Names of encrypted journals will not appear on IFTTT. The order will coincide with the journal order in the app. The journal ID can also be located to match up the correct encrypted journal. See here.

Troubleshooting

If your journals do not appear when creating a new applet, you may not be connected properly to your Day One account in IFTTT.com

Please see this guide on reconnecting a service on IFTTT: https://help.ifttt.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010229587-How-do-I-change-the-account-associated-with-a-service-

[Intro]
'Cause I like you
I won't take it

I won't take it there because I like you
I know if I shouldn't but I'd like to
I know if I sh-
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I've been
Looking up too close at the serpent's face
Like please don't come around me, stay
Out of this gaping pit, I climb myself up out it
I got out a real bad place
I ain't [known?], bring my friends around it
I don't need the house no one here but some mons-
Stuff is crowded
Anti-social loneliness, I do this to myself
But I'm all good, no doubt
I just got shit I just can't figure out
Got it wrapped round' my finger now
She put me through the wringer now
I'm glad I wasn't around

Saba “Come My Way' Official Lyrics & Meaning | Verified

Arrow Left #1 Icon Created with Sketch.

Arrow right #1 Icon Created with Sketch.

And (and)
I don't make plans for too far in the future
There's no telling
I don't waste breath on if they like me
Or what they say about it
I don't wanna rot at some place
I just happened to hang around then
Can't save what's not drowning

[Bridge]
I'm in deep flames high
Strung and set on fire
Gasoline, I can smell my fry
I can see it through these melted eyes

[Verse 2]
Stuck myself inside this [bar?] right on the side
(Woah)
No, I'm not civil but if you met me
You'd say I'm nice, though
It's not that simple
Watch me trip over my tied shoes
And I know I shouldn't take it there
But I'd sure like to
Hold my head up, hold my hand and look both ways and back behind you
Not gon' act like all my traits are figured out
It's nice to fine-tune
I'm still taking it day-by-day but I'm much better when beside you
All these incorrect ways I see myself am tied to
(Yeah)

[Outro]
I won't take it there because I like you
Don't know if I should check in but I'd like to
I made my own you in my own mind too
My head's swelling, calling me to write to
It don't take that much just to lie too
Don't do much but I'll admit sometimes I'd like to
Girl, can we just talk it out? I don't wanna fight you
It's easier said than done to leave it all behind you

## 2022-03-02T22:54:51.094Z - The Truth is

You never really heal from certain traumas. They become a part of you forever. The only hope is that you don’t become the people that hurt you. It’s not fair that they did what they did to you, but it’s more unfair that you cause someone else the same trauma just because it was done to you. Know the difference, break the cycle or the cycle keeps repeating. Year after year, generation to generation.

## 2022-03-15T06:08:12.493Z - A Few Years back I Came across what Used to Be an Unknown and Hidden Website Called “weboas.is”

It will always be one of my favorite internet discoveries.

This was no ordinary website, this was as if someone had a master key to all of the hidden and unknown places on the web and then created a back door to them from a central location. A web portal known as “Weboas.is”

While most people used this site for piracy, leaks and other things. I used it for the forum, more specifically for the “Admin’s Finds” section which is where I met Webby.

He was the founder and creator of weboasis (and the one person I thought may have been a glitch in the matrix,) because he had so much knowledge of the internet and knew how and where to find some pretty amazing things.

Once a week he would drop a shit ton of links that he had discovered and I would go through them all and provide feedback afterwards. Everything on the site and the forum was encrypted and every person was anonymous. Especially Webby and Webby was not his real name. The only thing I know is that he was born in 1992 and he signed all his posts and updates as Webby.

A few months back, he started posting less and less to the forum and I began looking for new sources or sites like his. (With no luck)

Anyways I went to go see if maybe he had dropped some new links on the forum and when I got to the forum I saw this 😔

He uploaded his source code and about 20 mirrors to the site have come to life since.

He was an unbelievably smart and awesome person
And It sucks he chose to take his own life in order to find peace.

R.I.P Webby

For anyone interested in what he created and did with weboasis, here’s a link to a mirrored site that someone created and archived since his passing.

Throughout life, I've often heard people say “you never forget the way people make you feel”

 you never forget the way somebody you love ignores you or neglects you or chooses to spend their time with somebody else.

Those feelings they stay with you forever

## 2022-06-08T15:32:16.703Z - Blueprints To A Better Future---

Always Communicate
Understand yourself and learn to understand how your significant other Communicates.
Without Communication there is no Relationship. Period.
Always Be Honest.
If you do or say something bad, own that shit and apologize.
Pride and being stubborn has no place when it comes to making mistakes. That's the devils work and fuck that guy.
When you lie your relationship will bleed and so will the person you lied to.
Understand YOUR Needs and the things YOU value.
It's just important to understand THEIR needs and what they value as well.
Every Relationship is different because every single person is different.
What happened in your previous relationships have no place in your current one.
Just because you were lied to, cheated on or neglected before doesn't mean the same thing will happen with this new person. If you go into a new relationship with that mindset, you are metaphorically holding a gun to the head of this new person and have condemned the relationship to fail right from the beginning.
Every person has baggage and wounds from someone else, it is your responsibility to be open and understanding to why people feel the way they feel and to talk about it in ways that helps your relationship.
When people have been hurt, they don't always like to talk about it. Opening up is hard and even harder when it's to someone new and someone you have feelings for. This might be because they don't want to feel embarrassed or stupid or judged or vulnerable.
Be patient and be understanding.
Take the time to heal from your heartbreaks
This really should be Number 1 on this subject because people don't understand that you can't just jump into a new relationship right after your previous one fails.
You have to heal your wounds. You have to understand why the relationship ended. You have to feel that pain and those aches in your stomach to the full extent.
DO NOT run from that pain. Face it and find acceptance and closure before moving on.

## 2022-06-08T15:33:38.235Z - Foreword

First and foremost, I have written and created this book just for you. It’s the only way I know how to really show you and tell you how much you mean to me.

I have had this overwhelming feeling that somewhere deep down, you might think that I don’t care or that I don’t love you but that couldn't be further from the truth.

You are all the best parts of me and a better version of me than I could ever be.

I feel as if Life dealt us a pretty unfair hand. In a sense that we have never really had a real opportunity to fully bond with each other.

I don’t hold anyone accountable except for myself for the things that I’ve done wrong.

Your mom made the right choice and the right decisions so her and Jason could give you the best life possible.

I couldn't see it back then, but I see it now.

I’ve been a mess and unstable, it seems like my entire adult life. I’m not a good role model and never have been. I am thankful that Jason stepped up and has been able to be all of the things I couldn't be. The same way my Dad did when my Biological Father decided he didn't want me.

I am not my biological father though. I would never abandon you. Though in some ways, maybe that’s what it feels like to you.

Honestly, Jason is one of the only fathers on the planet that I have immense respect for. He’s always been good to you and he’s always been good to me. There are no hard feelings. No jealousy or resentment.

## 2022-06-08T15:35:59.752Z - I Know what Depression Is, what it Feels Like. What it Does to You, what it Makes You Do to Others. I Know when it’s here and when it Goes away

This isn’t depression. This is something different. This is a place void of all emotion. There’s no anger or darkness. No sadness or happiness. Just an empty vessel that runs on Adderall and technology.

I don’t communicate what I feel to anyone anymore. I avoid conversation as much as possible. I push those that care away. I want to believe it’s because I don’t want them to be infected by this purgatory inside me. That’s probably what you want to hear rather than me just saying I don’t care if I sever the lines that I have intertwined and attached to those who are closest to me.

I am a fraud and a hypocrite. I wanted to be better and do better but I am who I am and if I can’t change that, than that is and will always be the end of it.

I don’t feel suicidal in any way, I don’t have the effort or ambition to end this. I just wake up every day and repeat the same day on an endless loop that resets every time I shut my eyes at night.

Infinite Loop

An infinite loop, which repeats indefinitely, is often created when a programmer writes a loop in which the expression tested never becomes false.
