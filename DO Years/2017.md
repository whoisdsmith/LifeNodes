## 2017-01-01T07:51:26.000Z - I'm so Lost Anymore. I Literally Have no One to Talk To. Stevie Doesn't Understand Me and Never Will. She's Always Got Travis to Talk to when She's Upset, but no One Ever Gives a Shit about Me when I'm Upset. It is what it Is, Fuck it I've Always Been a Loner even when I Didn't Have to Be. Happy Fucking New Year

## 2017-01-08T04:45:18.000Z - Took the Girls to My Moms and Let Everett Stay home with Travis so Stevie and I Could Go Do Dinner and a Movie

We ate at Sarku Japan in the mall and then watched the movie Passengers.

The night was ok till we got home and then it just all went down hill. I would say it was the worst night ever but I've been saying that way too often anymore.

It's hard to let go of someone you love so much but when the fuck is enough enough?

## 2017-01-15T01:37:00.000Z - I Often Wonder how Many

## 2017-01-15T02:41:05.000Z - Stevie and I Got into a Big Fight and I Broke a Glass Mug, Kicked the Bathroom Door in and Punched the Tv Rendering it Useless

## 2017-01-16T04:39:37.000Z - 2017-01-15-113900

First day I officially met The greatest Robotinest of all time.

## 2017-04-26T12:29:00.000Z - Life Has Gotten so much Better with Every New Day. So Many Opportunities Have Opened Up, so much More Positivity. For the First time in a long time I Can just Be Myself Again, no One to Keep Me Boxed in and no One Telling Me how I Should Live My Life. This is how it Should Have Always Been but I Guess You Compromise and You Change for the Person You Love. I Believe We Were Always in the Same Book just Too Many Chapters ahead of Each Other. I Believe We Could Have Made it Work and I Fought for that until the Very End. I'm not Going to Talk Any Shit on here about Stevie. She Gave Me 3 Beautiful Children and Many Good Years of Love, but Most of All She Gave Me a Lot of Lessons on what a Relationship Should or Shouldn't Be so I Can now Move on and not Make Those Mistakes Again. It is what it Is, People Fall out of Love Every Day and Sometimes You Can Never Go back to Those Good Feelings Again and It's Best to Move On. I Never Gave up though but This time I Had no Choice. I'm Finally Good with that though because at Least I'm Still Somewhat Young and Handsome and Funny. My Feet Keep Moving forward and I'm not Ever Stopping to Look back because for Me There's Nothing there that Could Bring Those Positive Feelings back and I Would Never Be Able to Trust Her Again. We both Made Mistakes and We Have both Moved On. So long Story short My Life's much Better now

Don't go fuck up somebody's marriage though because that shit is not cool, but I ain't even mad cause I realized that some bitch ass dude did me a favor. So on that note I'm getting back on my grind and doing what I do best, which is being handsome and funny and white Russians

I've been doing really good with trying to put all the pieces of myself back together and keeping myself on a better path, but I had so much negativity coming at me today that it brought me down from the clouds and put me into the lowest of lows. That's the shit you have to stay away from because if you don't do anything to counteract that negativity it will consume you and torture you until you decide it's time to end this shit right here and now. I just give no fucks right now. My whole life just flipped the fuck upside down and just gets worse with every new day. I gotta get out of here

I'm beyond grateful for all the people who have cheered me up, talked to me and help me through this shit. Stuart Weaver you already know man. Youve had to get up earlier than me to drive from Marshall to tekonsha to pick me up and take me to work these last two weeks not to mention the other millions of things you and Caitlin Weaver have done for me. K.w. Travis Linnabary you already know bro. I ain't even gotta say it. Alan DeGraw dude thank you for everything yesterday! Kevin Stuart you've been with me through this shit for 5 years, now we can finally hangout again without me having a curfew lol. Kristin Ruffner-Kasserman you and I were best friends and I had to cut you out of my life for 5 years. I thought I had burned those Bridges and you still friend requested me and chose to still be my friend. Thank you. Sarah Warner thanks for the insight, shit can only get better from here! Gary Wintersteen Dude! You dropped by unexpected just to check up on me that was awesome, and then drove back out to give my girls some toys from you and Jen because they didn't have any! thanks so much man! and last but not least and I guess I should have started with you but thank you Lori Herman Smith for being there for me just like you always have been.

There's 2 sides to every story but sometimes there's a part of that story that nobody knows. I just saw Stevie's version so I'll just share for those of you who haven't. For the most part she's right but I never gave up trying to be better. I've already shared my version of how it ended but most of you don't know the way it really played out and I'm not going to share it because fuck it, we do what we have to do to feel better about ourselves and to be happy, some of us are just more selfish

I've literally been writing a status update for an hour now, I write a shit ton of paragraphs about how I'm feeling and then I just save them as a draft because I know there isn't a word or a thing I could do to change the situation. I'm glad I got all the kids with me but the nights are the worst, my life is upside down and hers is spent being happy with someone else. 8 weeks after we got married. I'm trying to get on and move on and let go but my feelings and memories from the last 1,982 days doesn't have an on/off switch. It sucks it really does, I thought I deserved more than a text message to end our story. There wasn't anyone in the world who could take me away from you. I just feel like I'm nothing more than boxed up memories waiting to start the next bonfire. Fuck it

It's hard not talking to someone you spent 1,982 days with, especially since I was so anti social. Through all this shit I still miss being able to talk. The last 9 days have been full of emotionless texts and silence. We can't even have a phone conversation, let alone talk face to face. I wish I could get over this as quickly as she did, I wish it didn't bother me with the thought of who's she's with. She turned her feelings for me off and expected me to turn mine off too. If I knew where to find the on/off switch, I wouldn't be on here talking to myself at 5 am

I'd say we're even but this wasn't about getting even. It was about the truth, and getting the facts straight so I can move on with my life. We both could have done things differently but what's done is done. Maybe someday we can be friends again but I'll probably be dead long before that time comes. I gave you so much more than you gave me credit for. Someday you'll finally realize that the problem wasn't always me and I never gave you a single reason to justify your actions the way you did. You got what you wanted and I got what I didn't deserve. The only thing I see you as, is the mother of our daughters, other than that you're fucking dead to me. This is the last time I'm even going to speak about you on here. I'll see you on the other side.

As far as Landon goes he really doesn't know what he wants! He's got everything he needs so... other than that I can't give you all any ideas!
Please comment below if you plan to attend also if your bringing children because I need to finish buying the goodie bag items!!!

I Gave You so much More than You Gave Me Credit For. Someday You'll Finally Realize that the Problem Wasn't Always Me and I Never Gave You a Single Reason to Justify Your Actions the way You Did. You Got what You Wanted and I Got what I Didn't Deserve. The only Thing I See You As, is the Mother of Our Daughters, other than that You're Fucking Dead to Me.

This fucking guy don t know how much of a favor he did me and he sure as fuck does not have a clue what the fuck he's in for. So we good bub!

Forgot to mention that I no longer have a filter, this is who I am and if there's a sentence that doesn't have the word fuck in it, well than someone hijacked my shit. Don't expect an apology if something I say is offending or hurts your feelings, I'm not here to please anyone but myself and as long as I think I'm cool, I don't really give a fuck what anyone else thinks. I've got a big heart and I care for those closest to me very deeply but for now I packed up all my emotions and all of my feelings and tucked them down inside all of our wedding shit before I set that bitch on fire. It was like being reborn again. I also talk way too much when I should be sleeping but now it's a little late for sleeping so I guess I'll start the coffee and practice my kegles. 💯🤓😎👊👍

So without trying to be pissed off and angry I'm going to simply ask if anyone has any pictures of me and you before 2011, could please message me them? Stevie literally erased me from existence pre 2012. I'm not trying to add more shit to the list of things wrong with her but this is definitely the one thing that pisses me off the most. One night in 2013 she went through every single email, facebook message, MySpace and anywhere else I talked to people and she deleted everything. EVERYTHING, there is not a single file on my computer to this day that predates 11/16/11. The worst part is I had a 1 TB hard drive full of music and photos and my life from early 2000s to November 2011. She smashed it on the cement till it was in multiple pieces. I wish I could make this shit up cause it's so fucking insane when I hear myself read this shit out loud. So long story short if you've got pics of us together message me or tag me please cause I need to fill this fucked up 6 year gap in my life

I have never felt such a wave of inspiration in my life, every word poured out of me like my mind finally figured out how to properly interpret how and what I feel in the correct way. I stopped writing a long time ago because my wife said I never spent enough time with her and I guess I always used that as an excuse but here's what I realized, as much as I loved her, she was nothing more than a firewall that blocked all of the best parts of me from the world. I am one step closer to being who I was supposed to be this whole time and God Damn does it feel good

## 2017-05-13T16:45:27.000Z - Day 23

I wrote an alternate ending for my marriage, not about something fictional but how it really should have ended. All stories come to an end, but I never really saw ours ending the way it did. The original ending is full of missing pages and confusion and too much hate, anger and pain. I was the victim and my wife was the villain. That's the ending most of you know, which is definitely one that would leave you wanting a refund for the sheer amount of disappointment. That ending left me feeling unable to move on without proper closure. So I wrote a better ending of how it all should have played out, this time around me and my wife are both the victim's because of years and years of miscommunication and misunderstandings. By the last paragraph we both end up on the same page and we forgive each other and we give the answers to all those questions that got stuck in limbo. We hugged each other one last time and wished nothing but the best as we journey on to the next chapter in our lives without each other. I'm sure this all sounds confusing as fuck but I started defining my life as a book and each new major event started a new chapter me and my wife had the longest chapter to date but I won't accept the original ending because at the end of the day I just can't allow myself to hate. I have this gift or curse of being able to forgive someone no matter what happened.

Happy mother's day Rebecca Rodriguez, Thank you so much for always being an awesome mom to our son! I know that when he's with you and Jason, I don't ever have to worry about him cause he is and always has been loved and taken care of! It is greatly appreciated and I'm so thankful for that because not all children are so lucky to have a mother that will put them first, believe me I know!

Here is some words of wisdom for today..
Stay Who You Are
Be the best friend you can be to those who care about you
Always continue to better yourself, accept who you are and do the best you can to love and take care of yourself
Last but not least. STOP looking for love, love will always find you

Guess my wife couldn't delete me from everyone's hard drive lol.. me and my bff had a lot to catch up and shit probably won't be caught up for awhile, I'm a fucking asshole for cutting her out of my life, especially when she was at a point in hers where she could've used me the most. Can't change it now, but Stevie couldn't change it either, in the end me and Kristin still ended up being friends and Stevie just looks like a giant controlling asshole. Here's a bit of advice going into a new relationship, don't fuck with someones past life that you were never involved with. Nobody has the right to erase people from history just because they're feeling jealous or insecure. I lost more than just some of the best nights of my life but also 10 years worth of music I wrote that I'll never get back, pictures of my son as a baby I'll never get back, countless stories I wrote about. All fucking gone because someone wanted to be a child. You didn't change shit, you just made it harder for me to get what I lost back. It might have been worth it if you hadn't gone and did what you did, but you took so much more from me on top of the affair and the bullshit that followed. I didn't deserve any of it and you don't ever deserve to be happy again.

I would've never cheated on you ever... But I hope Tyler does it every chance he gets cause you fucking deserve it. Maybe he will be the one to give you the extension cord and do us all a favor

I Know It's Been a long time for Me, Im Use to Losing Sleep for All the Wrong Reasons. This Time, I'm Looking forward to Getting out of Bed and Being a Better Worker than I've Ever Been. Most of All I'm Ready to close This Chapter of the Last 6 Years Forever. That Was Really just My Rough Draft, This next Chapter is Going to Be so much Better because I Have so Many Mistakes that I Know how to Correct This time around and We All Deserve a Fresh Start on a New Page. Stevie I Do Forgive You for Everything, it Took Me a Minute to Realize the More I Hated You the More it Kept Me from Closing the Final Chapter. I Do Wish You the Best and You Can Continue to Be as Mean and Heartless to Me as You Want, but the only Person It's Going to Hurt is You because You Won't Let Go of whatever Hate You Have for Me. I Finally Put Every Last Feeling both Good and Bad into the Last Paragraph of This Chapter. After I post This, that Chapter and All of Those Feelings Will Be Done with Forever. This is the Official Start of the next Chapter in My Life and I'm Going into it the Right way This time

9:28 AM
Life goals.
Be a better man today than yesterday. Every day.
..
Say how you feel and not what someone wants to hear
Be honest. The truth can suck but lying about it makes any situation hard to come back from.
Follow your passion and do what makes you happy, I guarantee you'll find someone waiting for you when you get there.
Take care of yourself, accept your flaws, learn from them and move on.
Love yourself, this is the biggest issue we all struggle with. The worst thing you can do going into a new relationship is not love yourself because you just end up putting someone else through the same shit as you did the last person and the issues get blamed on everything else. Nobody is perfect, I make mistakes every day, I'll never stop because there's just some things in life I have yet to come across for the first time. I accept that that is going to happen at some point and we all should. People can cloud our judgement and distract us from the real issues that start with ourselves, it's very easy to not give a shit about yourself and yes most of us can probably do that and still care about someone else but it'll never be to your full potential. Change the things you have control over, accept the things you don't. This is all from my perspective and based on shit that's happened to me or to people around me. I guess that's really one of the only benefits of getting older, is understanding myself more and the world around me.
Just some thoughts if you want to move forward or change the direction you're life has been going

I owe you an apology for everything. I've been an asshole because I was mad at the choices youve been making, choices that effect me and the girls. I have accepted everything that's happened and I found a way to turn off any and every feeling I've ever had for you. The more I hate you the further back I go. I have to forgive you for everything before I can move on to this new chapter. I won't ever talk anymore shit to you. Guess that was my way of hanging on subconsciously. It's your life and you do what you want with it. We are finally set free of each other and I've never been so excited about what's in store for my future although I do have a pretty good idea. I will be civil for the girls and I will do anything I can for them but that's it. I'm really glad you let me go, because I wasn't living I was just waiting to die. So in the end of our story together I forgive you and I thank you at the same time.

If you could see what I see,
You'd believe me when I say that I see beauty.
Beauty in the structure you convey,
But somewhere along the way you got lead astray to a place you were not meant to be
You keep deciding to stay and not continue this journey of love we started,
Because you became hard hearted
You're as lovely as diamonds but you're hard like them too
You put up walls for all the times this world has hurt you
Making yourself into a statue, so no one can get too close to you
But I remember when you were clay,
Clay I would hold and mold as you walked with me
Showing the potential of what you could be,
Way more precious than gold, but you became cold
This statue, unable to continue because you think your failures define you
They bind you to this state of feeling hopeless and worthless
Why can't you see you're gorgeous and made for a purpose
The burdening agony is made up from the fallacies of voices telling you what to believe
You listened to every single one of them, except me
Darling, look past the lies and realize that this love is all you need
So take my hand and continue this journey
Follow me, follow me
But you're so scared to open up your fractured heart
Every time you do it always manages to fall apart,
Grinding into a soft sand, but dear if you take my hand I promise I will never leave you
I can show you what it means to be alive and not make you feel dead inside
If you could see what I see,
You'd believe me when I say that I see beauty
I will wait for the moment you catch your breath
I will wait for the moment you wake from death
I will wait for the moment you take that first step
I will wait, I will wait
But until then I just want you to know,
You're beautiful and you're not alone
I will wait for the moment you catch your breath
I will wait for the moment you wake from death
I will wait for the moment you take that first step
I will wait, I will wait
Consider it a treasure to ...

Wasn't trying to ruin your night. It actually really bothered me which is why I said something to them. Anyways, who gives a shit what people think. We all make mistakes. Just keep your head up, keep doing what you're doing, your life is much better now than a month ago. I told you we were 💯. I'll always have your back, you're always going to be my girls mom. What I want for you has always remained the same no matter what you thought and that is to be as happy as you can be. Anyways I gotta be up for work in like 3 hrs. I just wanted to tell you again that I don't hate you. I'm doing really good being myself again. We're gonna be just fine. Take care
11:00 PM
I wrote this about myself the other day. I learned a lot about life from you. Maybe there's something you can take from this as well

Life goals.

Be a better man today than yesterday. Every day.
..
Say how you feel and not what someone wants to hear

Be honest. The truth can suck but lying about it makes any situation hard to come back from.

Follow your passion and do what makes you happy, I guarantee you'll find someone waiting for you when you get there.

Take care of yourself, accept your flaws, learn from them and move on.

Love yourself, this is the biggest issue we all struggle with. The worst thing you can do going into a new relationship is not love yourself because you just end up putting someone else through the same shit as you did the last person and the issues get blamed on everything else. Nobody is perfect, I make mistakes every day, I'll never stop because there's just some things in life I have yet to come across for the first time. I accept that that is going to happen at some point and we all should. People can cloud our judgement and distract us from the real issues that start with ourselves, it's very easy to not give a shit about yourself and yes most of us can probably do that and still care about someone else but it'll never be to your full potential. Change the things you have control over, accept the things you don't. This is all from my perspective and based on shit that's happened to me or to people around me. I guess that's really one of the only benefits of getting older, is understanding myself more and the world around me.

There's comfort in knowing that the worst is all behind me now, like there isn't anyway you can hurt me anymore than you already have. Nothing will ever top that cake that has your name on it, but I made it through the worst part and I'm still in tact and got a good head on my shoulders. After all this shit, I just want you to be happy cause that's all I ever wanted from the beginning. I'm not going down that same road I took 10 years ago. Nobody is going to be hurt from my actions this time around. I'm finally free

I will take advantage of every day that I feel like this because I know days like yesterday they will still happen but as time goes by it will be less and less. I have grown up enough to accept the things for what they are and to understand and stay humble during this new chapter in my life.
Here's the one thing I've really taken from all of this.
Love does not rescue you, it doesn't take you away from whatever situation you're in with somebody else. it doesn't chase you all over the world and it sure as hell doesn't make you chase it back. Love is something that comes out of nowhere, it meets you in the middle when you're ready and when it is ready. You can go out and look for it all you want but you're just going to be disappointed, you have to use time and patience to it's advantage and I guess that's what the hardest part is, but the sooner you awknowledge that, the faster your mind and your heart will heal and the sooner you will meet in the middle.

Once you realize your self worth, suddenly those mountains in front of you become just small piles of dirt you can step over. The mind is a powerful thing and it can be deceived so easily, don't let anyone take control of the wheel that is your life, don't be a passenger while someone robs you of your own life because ultimately that just makes you an accomplice to the path of destruction that you create when you believe you'll never be good enough. Love will never change you into something worse, that's not what love does. Broken people are who try and break you down to live the way they do and they don't understand the real concepts of love, only how to make themselves feel better which is usually by destroying all of the good things inside of you. Don't be a hostage, be a fucking valet driver and show them the door, do it while you're still you.

the first three weeks were really hard to cope with I lost the biggest part of my life in the most heartbreaking way possible even after everything went down you still had me all wrong I basically return to a much better version of the old me I've got all my friends back I've got my music back I've got myself back on track I never was in love with Kristin she's been there for me during every single hardship I've gone through she absolutely loves her husband and their family I love that No respect that I will never have feelings for her and more than a friendship way I'm just trying to be your friend she's always been to me I've got so much shit I want to say but I don't know where to begin I wish you would have believed in me the way I did you I made you a promise that I would never leave and never cheat on you I kept both of those promises I'm not perfect but I know now that I was not to blame for everything that went wrong I still can't believe you let me on use me for a paycheck and lie to my face every time I asked you about Tyler I don't know if you realized how much you were smitten around him when I was around or if he flat out didn't give a shit and was hoping I would just leave and move out on my own you spent 90% of our relationship accuse me of cheating or believe Being I would leave you and you did both of those to me why how did I not deserve the chance for you to tell me how you really felt there are no excuses for what you did and there is no way to justify it I never did anything to deserve this I hope you know you were wrong about me chasing you and wanting you back I never loved anyone more than I loved you you took that love and threw it in the trash while you develop feelings that lead into an affair in my own house I don't think you nearly as much as I did two weeks ago I thought this was going to destroy me I thought about suicide every day for two weeks straight then I just woke up one day and knew everything was going to be just fine for me I made so much progress with myself and with my life it's too bad you felt like you had to hold me back from my True potential because I am capable of doing amazing things and I would have figured out a way to show you that we could've been happy together but you did what you always said you wouldn't you gave up is angry as I am at you for living a lie with me I'm also very thankful that you set me free between my kids family and my friends I have never been as happy as I am now I know I deserve better than you no one should ever hurt someone the way you did me go ahead and continue to deny or justify it but you're just making yourself into a better liar not a better person you may think your life is perfect and you've never been this happy but it's all a lie you continue to tell yourself every day because you used to tell me all that shit you tell Calling Tyler now I'll put this in writing so you have proof later on but you and Tyler are not going to work out I've always seen things in all perspectives whether he hurt you or you hurt him your time together is already running out I was not perfect but even on my bad days I'm still a better man than he will ever be I don't give a fuck how big his dick is he is a home wrecking piece of shit who will do the same to you as you did to me you should've tried more instead of moving on to someone else because I know one day you're going to wake up and regret trading me in for an older less efficient model you should've found someone better than me because now you're already on course to fail we had a good thing and you ruined it but I'm not mad anymore because unlike you I chose to get an upgrade someone who loves me for me and will never make me sadder Replace the things I love out of jealousy or insecurities it's ironic the more I become who I used to be the more I laugh at you and think the old me is who you fall in love with all the irony in your actions I'm glad you made sure to sever all ties between us because it open my eyes to a much better life maybe you might get there too but as I said before it won't be with Tyler---

I'm good all on my own, I don't need anybody to make me happy and I sure as fuck don't need anybody who tries to make me feel worthless, I set the bar pretty high for being a good man, in fact I'm so confident in saying that, that maybe you women should start having your boyfriend's let me show them how they're supposed to love and treat you. I'm not perfect but I wasn't the reason why my not soon enough ex wife left. If I wasn't a good man than the next guy would have been a better one but see I have to continue to support her and her new boyfriend so they don't get evicted. If your own damn boyfriend can't support and take care of you then ladies and gentlemen, you just downgraded. That makes me feel good about myself and also denies those facts you claimed all those nights I was a so called worthless piece of shit, or that I would never find anyone better than you. Here's the thing you were right about me not finding anyone better than you because guess what, when you are in a marriage YOURE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE BETTER! I was just there to pay your bills and watch the kids so you could go fuck around. Looks like I still have to continue doing that when were not even together but hey it's the least I could do since you're the one who did me the favor. If you want someone better than me, I suggest you keep looking lol

It's been 40 days since I began this new chapter of my life and for the first time I'm completely content. I'm in a good place and the sun's not even out! The hardest part so far hasn't been what happened, it's realizing how much I sacrificed and missed out on. I pretty much got with my wife and left everyone behind, those closest to me know that was not by choice either but I never had the balls to stand up for myself or simply walk away. Walking away is not who I am though, I made a commitment and a promise and I was willing to go through hell every day to keep those promises. Fortunately, she didn't share the same insight and looking back now, she gave me my life back. I appreciate every single person that's helped me and been here for me, I've been a really shitty friend for a long time but this time I'm going to make the right commitment to those most important instead of 1 single person who wanted me all to h...

I don't really think I've felt this much negativity towards anyone in my life, I thought I hated my son's mom when she left me but this runs much deeper than that ever did, because we had a family together and plans and even got married, I never thought I would get married and she just fucking ruined it for me. I wish I never met up with her that first night we got together. She's a fucking poison I can't get out out of my system. Every where I go, there's memories of us, everything I do I vision her reaction, she's the worst thing that ever happened to me

That pain you're feeling in your heart right now can rebuild you or destroy you. It is you and only you who can decide which outcome will be your destiny. See that one person that made you feel so broken has already moved on, they will never care if you fall apart, you are as non existent to them as you were the day before you entered their life.

Why continue to use them as an excuse to feel sorry for yourself? Let it go. Let them go. Turn that pain into motivation, rebuild yourself. Grow taller, grow stronger and start living again. It won't matter if you bathe in the sunshine or if you surround yourself in the darkest place, plant yourself where you're at and bloom into a better you. Rise above that pain and build an empire so high that you'll never feel that low again. The more you let go, the more you'll begin to live again and don't worry about that person who hurt you ever again, they will have no choice but to notice how you're doing once youre in that place that sits so high above them.

## 2017-06-09T09:50:00.000Z - Day 50!!

Today is my 50th day of this new chapter in my life. I have exceeded almost all expectations for myself with where I thought I would be right now. I'm not going to play pretend and put on a fake ass smile for anyone. I didn't think I was going to come out of this in anyway that was positive at all. I was crushed, my heart was broken in ways I never new were possible. I still have questions I'll never get answered, I still miss talking to that one person I talked to every day for almost 6 years.

My heart still sinks to my stomach every time I see them together but isn't this how it's supposed to be? If I didn't feel that pain in my heart and that sickness in my stomach, would I really have loved her? Would I have ever learned from my mistakes? Would I have been able to grow into a better person without this? This is me coming to terms with my life and with my own shit. I may be able to speak about her without wanting to go 💯 with my fists in the wall but I am in no way ready to forgive her, those last two weeks together still replay in my head all the time and its like reliving that nightmare all over again every time, but it has gotten better and will only continue to get better.

I know the only thing that can heal me is time and I know that my heart and my mind are in a better place with each new day. Parts of me were broke but I am not broken. I still see the colors in all of the art, I still hear the melodies in every song, and most of all I still feel a passion for wanting to love and to be loved again by someone else. So 50 days later I made some incredible progress with myself and my life. I hope the next 50 days are even better. I want to mention that if it weren't for those of you who helped me whether you realize you did or not, this post would have been much different, hell I might not of even been here to write this. So thank you.

Forgetting you is not an option, it was not built into the features of who I am and who I am now has a lot to do with who I became when I was with you.

In the end there wasn't a whole lot of good things I could say about you or our relationship, but every new day I wake up, I start to see through that pain and that anger you caused me. I still think of you everyday, sometimes all day and sometimes only right before I fall asleep. I Let Go of any hope of us making this marriage work, when you made me move out and you moved him into our home as soon as I left. I believe it is possible to miss the good things that we had and still be able to move on without you cause I've been doing it ever since I left. Some days I hold on for dear life to that resentment because it's what I need to do to be able to keep moving forward. Some days I dig deep for anything that was positive between us to also help me keep moving forward. Just depends on my mood, and what the situation I'm in may be. It's a constant battle of my mind in my heart, I can't keep playing both sides forever cause I know that in the end that pain and resentment will not be a part of me or who I want to be. When I'm I'm finally ready to move into my next relationship there will be nothing negative leading into it other wise I will just cause myself and someone else unnecessary pain.

I went on a steady decline after that and decided it would be a be a good idea to finish going through the 30,000+ photos we had together and fell instantly off the bandwagon.

Thankful I had Faithanne, Stu and Travis to talk me back out of that state of mind.

## 2017-06-12T03:26:47.000Z - Day 52

Today was better than yesterday, kids were good, hungout with Travis. Played guitar. That's about it

## 2017-06-12T04:45:22.000Z - I Never Wanted My Marriage to End the way it Did, but it Wasn't My Choice, even if time Travel Was Possible I Could Go back and Change Myself and All the Mistakes I Made and I Can Guarantee You the Outcome is Still the Same. You Can't Change Anybody but Yourself and Yes That's a Bitter Fucking Pill to Swallow Sometimes but now that the Fog Has Cleared out of My Head I Can See Shit so Clearly Now. I've Done More Shit to Better My Life in the Last 6 Weeks since My Marriage Ended than I Did in the Entire 6 Year Relationship and That's Some Real Shit, I've Stumbled a Few times I Still Have Moments where I want to Get Lost in that Abyss of what We Used to Be together but that Shit is just a Fantasy just like All Those Fairy Tale Endings. It's not Real and Life is not a Disney Movie

Without all the pain and sadness I'd be an emotionless asshole. I would have continued my journey using other women just to fill that void I myself would have created by not giving myself to someone 100% I'm not about that life. I'm about being that person who climbs out from all the fucking wreckage that life and shitty people have tried to bury me under. I'm not the same guy that grew up in a small town who never really followed through on anything he said he would. I half assed a lot of things in my life but that just isn't me anymore. I'm going to show those closest to me and those that believe in me that I am capable of much more than false promises and let downs.

I am the poster boy for those who want to overcome all their pain and insecurities, you don't have to drink and take drugs to feel ok, you have to be willing to change the way you think. You have to face all the awful shit you have done and all of the awful shit that's happened to you and forgive yourself and forgive those that hurt you. You have to be willing to continue walking through the hell of pain and memories so you can gather up all the shit that you need to let go of. Giving up is not an option, giving up means you're already dead and goddamn it I'm still very much alive.

I've been rebuilding myself every day and I've been doing it by taking all the energy out of everything negative that I have endured and using it for things that are positive. I'm going to build an empire so high that those who gave me that negative energy will have no choice but to see me. With every passing day I'm killing off insecurity after insecurity until one by one they don't exist anymore and when I start to think negative about myself I talk to those who got me where I'm at right now and refill myself with their positivity. One day soon I'm not even going to have to tell the world my story cause I be showing it instead. Call it bullshit, call it crazy or call it whatever you want but take the person I was the day my marriage ended and out him side by side with who I am now and maybe that will show you that I'm not fucking around when I say the shit I do.

## 2017-06-12T11:32:38.000Z - Day 53

Life is about living, not just being alive. It's about learning and growing and making mistakes. It's about forgiveness and finding what things make you who you are. It's about being getting hurt and getting the fuck back up every time you do. There's not a person on this giant rock that has never went through something difficult or heartbreaking. When you get your heart pulled out of your chest by someone who you made your entire world, you take some time to put it back in your chest and you grieve over it, take the time for it to heal while you seek out the things you really want for yourself.

Life is not about taking all your pain and emotions and keeping them locked up inside you while your defenses continue to build more walls so they'll never escape. That doesn't make you stronger it makes you hard to fucking love and makes you destroy the people who love you and what for? See here's the thing, I get it, some people don't like to get hurt, they don't like to get sad but I'm sorry to tell you these are things you must feel and you must deal with in order to actually love another human being. You can't just justify your defenses by saying "I don't want to get hurt" ain't no damn person out there who just wants to get hurt so shut the fuck up about that dumb shit. What you end up doing by not letting yourself open up for the possibility to be hurt is actually shutting that one person who cares about you out and you end up doing the exact bullshit to that person that you have avoided being done to you. You want to learn how to love and what it's really like to love someone else. Open the fucking door and welcome in the chance for somebody to hurt you. I've learned that no matter how much pain and heartache sucks it's made me appreciate wanting to be loved and wanting to love someone even more. Don't be a fucking asshole with these excuses you make for not wanting to get hurt. The majority of people just want to be loved as much as you do. Nobody comes into your life just to say "hey bitch imma wreck yo life on purpose". Quit being a bitch and let your guard down cause you will never truly love someone the right way until you give them that possibility to one day hurt you.

I Have not Let Myself nor Wanted to Be with Another Woman My Pimpin Days Were over the First Night I Kiss My Wife for the First time if She Could Hear Me now or See Me now I Think She Would Realize She Was Wrong about Me I'm not even Talking about Being Wrong for Leaving Me but Being Wrong about Who I Am and Have Become I Learned a Lot from Her Insecurities and Her Believe that I Was just a Guy Who Wanted Everyone but Her if that Were True it Would Be Her in My Shoes and not the other way around She is One Hell of an Ability to just Forget about Me and MoveOn like I Never even Existed I Do Miss the Good Parts of Her I Always Will Her Smile Will Disintegrate in Bed Feeling away for Me that Laugh in that Smile together Would light up Every Room She Would Walk into I Hope There's Still that Old Soul Left inside of Her is the Reason why I Chose to Be with Her She Meant Everything to Me and Try Try and I Try My Best to Show Her that in the only Ways I Knew how but it just Wasn't Enough I Tried to Change it to Somebody I Wasn't just Make Her Happy but All I Did Was Lose Myself and Make Her Hate Me I'm so Tired and Emotionally Drained Today I just Felt I Had to Write about This because It's Important to Me Who I Am now This Still Feels like a Dream to Me Sometimes I Guess because I Never once Picture My Life without Her Being in It---

Feeling incredibly sad today, just full on depressed as fuck. It's bringing out the worst in me and I can't seem to get past it. My doubts and insecurities have let themselves loose upon me. Every time I see Stevie my fucking stomach just ties itself in knots, I feel sick, I feel sad and I just want to wake up from this dream. Why can't this all just be a bad dream?

I didn't deserve any of this, I don't know who the fuck I am anymore. Ive never been able to tuck my feelings or emotions away and act like I'm just fine. I don't wear my heart on my sleeve, I wear it on my face and in the words I say. How am I supposed to let go when I fear there is nobody else out there that I will feel so passionately for. I know that relationship was fucked up and that it was because of her and her issues, but I thought I was somebody different to her, now I'm just like her last husband. Just some guy who pays her every Friday to see our children on the weekends. I'm nothing more than a stranger to her, I am a ghost floating through this life and the only thing that I haunt is myself. I just wish I could live up to the words I've been saying but this slump I've fallen into outweighs that motivation to better my life. Maybe I was always destined to be a sad piece of shit who goes nowhere in life but into a box 6 ft in the dirt buried all alone.

Up ahead, and I know I'm getting closer because the ocean is getting more shallow I continue swimming towards it, I'm so tired and exhausted from fighting the constant current that's in my way, especially when it's so much easier to just stop and let the current take me in the other direction, so that I can rest my eyes and my thoughts and scream that I don't give a fuck and just be done, but that's not who I am. I've fought for so long to hold on to the things that have long let me go. It's who I am, I don't believe in giving up on the things or the people that I love,

I can see dry land and the island that's full of all the good and the beautiful things in my life

Logic Concert with My Bro

## 2017-09-19T02:03:24.000Z - Please Read

There's some things I want to say, that I need to say and I have to say. I'm a mess right now, I really am. I haven't slept since you left and I've just found myself being really lost in life right now. The more pissed off I am at you, the less I think about you and the more I try and make myself believe that I don't care about you or love you. I drove through hell and back for almost 4 hours tonight just listening to music and thinking about my life. When you came back, it was everything I ever wanted. So believe me when I tell you that when I poured my heart and soul out to you and I forgave you. I meant all of it.

I am truly heartbroken, not because of what happened but because you spent all of these years believing I wanted everyone accept you and that if you ever left I would never chase after you. All that doubt you put in me created so many nights of fighting and facing the opposite wall, because it never mattered what I did or what I said to you, you had planted your feet in cement and chose to believe what wasn't real actually was. I know I'm not perfect, I know that after so long we grew distant and became strangers to each other. As disappointed and angry as I was that you put so little faith and so much doubt in me, I always continued to try and I truly never wanted anyone else. I know we had some bad fights and I know we both said and did shit we wish we could take back. I never gave up on you. I thought about my life and my future all day and night today and as the day grew lonelier into night I thought about us and I thought about you and everything that tore us apart. As I sat all by myself like I always do, I thought about you and this situation we ended up in and I asked myself. Even after all this do I still love her? Do I still want her? Do I still miss her? And the answer to all 3 questions was yes yes and yes. So that could mean there are many different reasons to why I feel that way. Is it because I'm alone and lonely? Is it because I only want what I can't have or is it because that's the only way I've ever felt? The correct answer is the last one. No matter what you think or believe it's the truth.

I dont know what part of anything you've said since August 19th is real or bullshit. I don't know what our future holds, I don't know anything anymore. You have to understand that you were never alone in our relationship, you had your doubts in me and and that always made me feel helpless and living that way for so long has really fucked me up mentally. No matter what you have said or what you think about me, the truth is your doubt and insecurities weighed down upon me so much that I became who I am now. I am fully aware I'm not that same guy you fell in love with almost 6 years ago, nobody knows that better than I do. I had a hundred friends back then and now I've got 3. There is a reason I'm telling you this and it's not because I want you to feel shitty or guilty, it's because for once I just want you to understand me. Our miscommunication was our greatest failure, but I became so helpless and hopeless when you let you're thoughts and anxiety take over and you wanted to believe I didn't love you or that you weren't going to be good enough or that I was going to find someone else and leave you. The more you chose to believe it, the farther I got from ever being able to show you that you were wrong about all of it. All I ever wanted was to get married and all you ever wanted was to believe I didn't love you. At least that's how I see it.

So what I'm trying to say here is that you didn't make me into who I am now, I chose to become who I am by proving you wrong about all the things you had chosen to believe and in doing so it really fucked me up mentally. I've got so many insecurities and so many issues with my temper. I know I need to go get a counseling because I'm a fucking mess and I don't like being so mad all the time. I want to believe I deserve better and that I'm better off without you but that contradicts everything I've ever stood my ground for in our relationship and that everything was all for nothing just because of our miscommunication and stubbornness. I always trusted you and I never once doubted your love for me and I sure as hell never pictured my life without you in it and you being with someone else.

I know you told everyone I did and said all these awful things about you and to you and yes some of it was true but that's not who I really am, that was me when I had hit rock bottom because of all the doubt you had in me. I knew exactly how I felt about you and no matter what I did or what I said you refused to believe it because you had spent so much time thinking about the what ifs or the things that could or might happen that I just couldn't convince you that you were wrong. The woman I have always loved more than anyone I ever have before spent all her time believing in a thought or a feeling that just wasn't true. You were always your worst enemy. W...

I don't care how pissed off you are because you don't get to be pissed off at me because of the choices that you made, so just get over that shit right now. I'm totally done having anything to do with what happened and anything in general that has to do with you.>> 2nd. Come get your shit please, it's suppose to rain Thursday so today would be a good time to get it cause half of it is filling up my car and the other half is outside.>> 3rd. I'm flying to Nashville tomorrow night for an interview on a tech position at Dell. Im pretty confident about getting the job because Jake and Deb both put in a good word and I'd be working in Deb's department too, my interview is at 9am on Thursday morning, I dont know how soon I would start if I get the job, Jake said it could be Monday or it could be in 2 weeks, my return flight to Detroit gets in at 7pm so I'll get a hold of you when I'm close to Homer.>> So if or when I get that job, I will be staying with Jake and Deb until I can get my own place. Which means I obviously won't be able to see the girls until Christmas time. I do want to see them, in fact I wish they could come with me but we both know that you would never let that happen. I wish you could understand why I have to do this. I'm fucked up over this marriage shit and I can't let go of it, every time I turn around there's more drama. I'm sorry about your clothes, I'm sorry for most of the shitty things I said to you, but for future reference don't use your future husbands as a rebound, cause there really isn't anything more humiliating. That shit was far worse than the affair.>> Anyways, all I want to do is get my life together and plan for a future where I am mentally and financially more stable. I'm going nowhere with my life right now, and me being here isn't helping me move on. I'm sorry if this pisses you off and if you think I'm a piece of shit, but this isn't about you, it's about me and I deserve to better my life anywhere I want. You'll be getting most of my money which I know is the only thing you are concerned about when it comes to me and the girls. I just hope you continue to take care of them. I really don't want to leave on bad terms, but if you can't accept it, than that's your choice but I deserve to be happy and to find a woman who actually wants to be my wife. I won't find either if I'm stuck in this hell up here and just think, once I'm gone, you and Tyler won't have shit to fight about. It's a win win for everyone.>> But for real though, I don't want to leave on bad terms. I just need you to let me go and if you ever really did care about me in some way, you would let me go so I can live a life without you and possibly with someone new. If you want to stay pissed off and mad at me for how I reacted to the shit you've done to me than so be it.>>> UNT. Dsmith out>
