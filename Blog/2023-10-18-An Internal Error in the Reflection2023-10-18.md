I guess I should finally put something in writing about who I am, who I’ve been and how I feel and what it’s like to be me. The way I am, the way I think.

I am not significant in any way. I’ve always known this, but when it comes to the way I think and I process things internally and externally, I am anything but normal. Most days I am simply on autopilot, I rarely talk and communicate with anyone. I find things to keep me busy on the internet and I get lost in it. I don’t think about people, family, friends, children, relationships or ex relationships. I know that probably sounds bad but it’s not meant to cause pain or hurt anyone’s feelings. It’s just how I’ve grown to be over the years.

Most of the time I don’t understand myself, so I understand when people get frustrated when I do something they don’t understand. I’m not like anyone else when it comes to the way I think and I feel about things. Everything I do probably comes off as selfish and I would agree with that. The irony lies in the fact that I can’t stand who I am and why I am the way I am.

I spent most of my adult life going back in the past, looking at things I don’t remember, keeping things that should have been deleted long ago.

My brain doesn’t work like your brain. I forget more than I ever remember. I keep doing shit in loops forgetting that I’ve already done something before.

For years I have been trying to gather all the data from my life and put it together in a way that makes sense to me. A way I can map out the reason I am the way I am. Something that might be able to explain to people that I don’t know how to. A blueprint for my children on what to do to NOT follow in my footsteps.

Everything you think you know about me, you don’t. My intent has never been to hurt anyone. I’m not heartless or emotionless but this self hatred I feel towards myself will always outweigh whatever someone else is feeling. Most of the time I understand why people feel the way they do. Why they have an issue with something that’s upsetting them. It’s not fair to them when I don’t respond or don’t have a reaction or answer.

It’s because there isn’t an answer I can give that will make sense or make the situation better. I would rather say nothing than say something that hurts people even more. Unfortunately I do this too often.

My self hate comes out towards the people who care instead of at myself.

I wasn’t always like this. I didn’t turn out this way because of other people. I think a lot of it has to do with the adderall. That’s on me though. Things that I have done to myself and chose to do are on me.

I’ve had enough time to process and dissect my past relationships to know that the way I am has always been what causes people to find someone else. I’ve accepted it. It’s not fair for anyone to be in a relationship with me. Im just wired wrong. I spend too much time being distracted that I ever will living.
