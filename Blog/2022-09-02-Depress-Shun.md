I know what depression is, what it feels like. What it does to you, what it makes you do to others. I know when its here and when it goes away.This isn't depression. This is something different. This is a place void of all emotion. There's no anger or darkness. No sadness or happiness. Just an empty vessel that runs on Adderall and technology.I dont communicate what I feel to anyone anymore. I avoid conversation as much as possible. I push those that care away. I want to believe its because I dont want them to be infected by this purgatory inside me. That's probably what you want to hear rather than me just saying I dont care if I sever the lines that I have intertwined and attached to those who are closest to me.I am a fraud and a hypocrite. I wanted to be better and do better but I am who I am and if I cant change that, than that is and will always be the end of it.I dont feel suicidal in any way, I dont have the effort or ambition to end this. I just wake up every day and repeat the same day on an endless loop that resets every time I shut my eyes at night.

**Infinite Loop**

> An infinite loop, which repeats indefinitely, is often created when a programmer writes a loop in which the expression tested never becomes false.
