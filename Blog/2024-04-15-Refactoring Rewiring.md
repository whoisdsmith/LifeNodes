> I’ve been here before, but I haven’t been here, before. 

My whole adult life, I have cried and complained about how life dealt me a shitty hand. It turns out the dealer was mostly me. I always wanted something I couldn’t have. I was obsessed with trying to understand why I could not get what I wanted. Ignorant and wasteful. So much time and so many years spent chasing people I no longer had. It seems I put all my effort and motivation into doing things that would bring them back to me. I was never doing anything that would actually benefit me in the long term. I guess my logic was that if I do this, or I be that, I’ll get what I want. The problem was that I already had what I wanted; I just didn’t put the time and effort into keeping it. 

So I’ll say it again. 

> I’ve been here before, but I haven’t been here, before. 

The place where you have to start all over. From the bottom. Up until today, no job, no vehicle, no home, although I got lucky enough that my mom has lent me her house and vehicle while she’s gone for the year traveling the US.

I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve been here at the starting line again. The difference is that I chose to be here. I’ve always understood the concept that doing the same things over and over will always produce the same results. I just always choose to ignore it and do it anyway. 

This time, I’m not chasing anyone; I’m not trying to be someone I’m not. I don’t even know who I want to be yet, but I do know it’s not who I’ve always been. I don’t see the world as dark and depressing as I used to, but I find myself hesitant to say or use words like “feeling or being hopeful”.

10 years ago, I would always update my social media accounts with whatever progress I thought I was making. I have no desire to do that again. If I fail, I’m going to fail quietly. The road ahead is not an easy one. I know what comes around goes around, and the ghosts of my past will come to collect soon enough.
