```
Do you ever stop and ask yourself “How did I get here? When did this path I’ve been on, start to veer off course? Why did I make those decisions that initially lead me to here?”
```

```
Every day is the same day over and over again. 
```

```
It’s like no matter what I do or say, when I go to bed and wake up the next day, everything resets and starts all over again
```

```
Life has become a simulation that I can’t outrun.

I know what depression is, what it feels like. What it does to you, what it makes you do to others. I know when its here and when it goes away.This isn't depression. This is something different. This is a place void of all emotion. There's no anger or darkness. No sadness or happiness. Just an empty vessel that runs on Adderall and technology.I dont communicate what I feel to anyone anymore. I avoid conversation as much as possible. I push those that care away. I want to believe its because I dont want them to be infected by this purgatory inside me. That's probably what you want to hear rather than me just saying I dont care if I sever the lines that I have intertwined and attached to those who are closest to me.I am a fraud and a hypocrite. I wanted to be better and do better but I am who I am and if I cant change that, than that is and will always be the end of it.I dont feel suicidal in any way, I dont have the effort or ambition to end this. I just wake up every day and repeat the same day on an endless loop that resets every time I shut my eyes at night.

**Infinite Loop**

> An infinite loop, which repeats indefinitely, is often created when a programmer writes a loop in which the expression tested never becomes false.

## My Internal Code Is Corrupted

I’ve known for awhile now that something wasn’t right.

The sounds of alarms were going off and error codes were being thrown but I chose to ignore them because they weren’t affecting me enough to the point where I couldn’t keep going.

Turns out, it’s the small things that end up crippling you the most.

Especially when they go unaddressed.

Those internal debugging features were installed to make sure the user runs and performs as smoothly as possible.

If there is an alarm or an error being thrown. **IT’S FOR A REASON!**

I knew that just as much back then as I do now.

That’s what I do though. I ignore anything and everything unless it stops me right where I’m at and I’m left with the only option to deal with it right then and there.

It worked for 37 years. I knew those faults and error codes would never fix themselves but I thought that I would get to a point in my life where I would care enough about myself to take care of myself.

I know now , that if I had taken the time to install bug patches and updates, that would have prevented me from continuing to run on a corrupted operating system.

There is no reset button, I can’t just wipe my internal operating system or clear my cache. We are not the same as computers. Computers will eventuality crash hard enough that they won’t run at all until you replace hardware or install a new OS.

Humans will continue to run even when they’re completely faulty and corrupted. Our brain just re-wires itself to keep operating even after the code it spits out is improperly encoded.

Maybe there’s someone out there who might still see some light and hope somewhere in that statement.

But I don’t. If I can’t fix my internal code that was written for me and only me, than nobody else can either.

I am in an endless loop that I can’t get out of.

Every day it uses more and more CPU, RAM and storage space.

Please take the time to address the small issues before it’s too late.

## The Realization That I Am Exactly Who I Have Been Trying To Avoid

I’ve got so many things I want to say, that I have to say, I just don’t know how. I don’t know how to communicate anymore. Everyone should be able to communicate their feelings, at the very least, we should be able to transfer those feelings from thoughts to something written. I can’t even do that anymore.

So many things have changed within me over the last few months. Things that I am aware of, things that I continue to ignore. I have so many things to be grateful for and to be thankful for. I have people who love and care about me, who go above and beyond to make sure I am ok and that I have whatever I want or need.

I don’t know why anyone continues to care about me. I am so hard to love, and it seems impossible to talk to…because I never say more than a few words. I am not this way on purpose or to be hurtful. I know I have hurt and offended people by ignoring them or being short with them.

I seem to have gotten entirely too comfortable being alone or by myself. When other people are hurting and going through shit, they tend to reach out to others, to talk to, to go have some drinks with, so they can forget about whatever they’ve been feeling, even if it’s just a temporary escape.

That’s not how I processed my emotions. I cut myself off from the outside world and plugged myself into a laptop or pc. Here, in this space, I could go wherever I wanted, do whatever I wanted, and distract myself from feeling anything at all.

If anyone said or did something to hurt me, I knew how to make it go away. Go Home. Take an Adderall. Pull the chair up to the computer, and 10 minutes later. Those words or actions became non-existent, and I guess eventually, So did I.

For so long, that was my **Superpower**.

I thought,

> ”go ahead and be an asshole or a shitty person to me, I’ll give you the satisfaction of 10 minutes of initial impact, and then, you’ll be discarded from my thoughts completely, as if you never even existed.”

Somewhere down the road, that process of “**coping**” and “**healing**” just turned into habit and I continued to plug myself into my digital terminal, while discarding conversation and basic human interactions with friends and loved ones.

Those close to me often say that I “live in a bubble” or that I “live in my own little world” words and phrases, I have heard so often, that my response is usually met with a look of “whatever” or with me “rolling my eyes” at them. It wasn’t because they were right, but because I didn’t want to admit that they were right or acknowledge that even though I was present in the conversation, I wasn’t really “present”.

That’s something I have grown to understand a lot in the last few months.

That even though I am “physically” present in the current conversation, I’m never really “**present**” mentally.

I know that must be so frustrating and irritating to the ones trying to communicate with me.

There are so many issues within myself that I have ignored, simply by telling myself they didn’t exist. That’s what I do when my operating system doesn’t run like it’s supposed to.

Ignoring my issues isn’t the only thing I’ve been ignoring lately, it’s been everything and everyone. Family, friends, bills, work, life. Everything.

I’ve been going through a bad wave of depression, constantly overwhelmed with the weight of feeling like a piece of shit. I can’t shake that feeling anymore, either.

This is Everett’s last year of High School, last year of him playing football, and I’ve already missed out on 3 games because there’s so much shit I feel at the moment when it comes to him.

He’s the reason I even started writing this, because I don’t know what he thinks or feels anymore. We never got to have that father and son bond like we should have. When it comes down to it, it wasn’t anyone’s fault for that. It was just life and the cards we were dealt.

Honestly, I’ve always been caught up in negative shit, and he is the exact opposite,
which is the best thing I could ever want for him.

Where I’m at in my head right now, I just feel like the farther away I am from him, the less he will be infected or affected by my current state. That’s not what I want him, he’s never been anything like me, and for that I am grateful.

If this is what it takes to keep going in the right direction, then I will continue to watch from the sidelines, cause even though I’m not actively there, I’m still there in the background, watching and cheering him on. I couldn’t be more proud of him. He exceeds at everything I failed at.

I am stuck in a constant state of error. Realizing and understanding there is something internally wrong with me. I have read the error codes over and over. The alarms are so loud now that they won’t let me ignore them anymore. The monitors are stuck flashing “Sink or Swim” I too, feel like I am stuck, unable to get out of this debug mode.

This internal code I have run on for 37 years is my DNA nobody can decode it but me. This is not a cry for someone to help or fix me, because no matter what your level of programming or troubleshooting is, you’ll never understand my code.

This is an issue that can only be fixed and addressed by me. All I think about right now is whether I will “Sink or Swim”.

## An Internal Error in the Reflection

**Date: 2023-10-18**

I guess I should finally put something in writing about who I am, who I’ve been and how I feel and what it’s like to be me. The way I am, the way I think.

I am not significant in any way. I’ve always known this, but when it comes to the way I think and I process things internally and externally, I am anything but normal. Most days I am simply on autopilot, I rarely talk and communicate with anyone. I find things to keep me busy on the internet and I get lost in it. I don’t think about people, family, friends, children, relationships or ex relationships. I know that probably sounds bad but it’s not meant to cause pain or hurt anyone’s feelings. It’s just how I’ve grown to be over the years.

Most of the time I don’t understand myself, so I understand when people get frustrated when I do something they don’t understand. I’m not like anyone else when it comes to the way I think and I feel about things. Everything I do probably comes off as selfish and I would agree with that. The irony lies in the fact that I can’t stand who I am and why I am the way I am.

I spent most of my adult life going back in the past, looking at things I don’t remember, keeping things that should have been deleted long ago.

My brain doesn’t work like your brain. I forget more than I ever remember. I keep doing shit in loops forgetting that I’ve already done something before.

For years I have been trying to gather all the data from my life and put it together in a way that makes sense to me. A way I can map out the reason I am the way I am. Something that might be able to explain to people that I don’t know how to. A blueprint for my children on what to do to NOT follow in my footsteps.

Everything you think you know about me, you don’t. My intent has never been to hurt anyone. I’m not heartless or emotionless but this self hatred I feel towards myself will always outweigh whatever someone else is feeling. Most of the time I understand why people feel the way they do. Why they have an issue with something that’s upsetting them. It’s not fair to them when I don’t respond or don’t have a reaction or answer.

It’s because there isn’t an answer I can give that will make sense or make the situation better. I would rather say nothing than say something that hurts people even more. Unfortunately I do this too often.

My self hate comes out towards the people who care instead of at myself.

I wasn’t always like this. I didn’t turn out this way because of other people. I think a lot of it has to do with the adderall. That’s on me though. Things that I have done to myself and chose to do are on me.

I’ve had enough time to process and dissect my past relationships to know that the way I am has always been what causes people to find someone else. I’ve accepted it. It’s not fair for anyone to be in a relationship with me. Im just wired wrong. I spend too much time being distracted that I ever will living.

## Villain Perspectives

![](https://begininfiniteloop.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/img_2057-1.jpg?w=1100)

**Date: 2024-01-15**

Today I finally know what it feels like to be the main villain in someone else’s story. Not in an evil or deliberate way, but in the way I understand how I’ve made them feel, by tearing their heart out.

I have always preached about **NOT** turning into the people that hurt you and yet I have done just that. Face to face with my actions and the consequences someone else has to pay for. I know that I am the cause of their pain. I know that I have made them feel the same way I wish others had never made me feel. This is not something I am glorifying or trying to perceive as being ok, it is an awareness I am acknowledging and taking responsibility for.

I know now that I will never change unless I am put in a position where I have no other choice. I am deeply sorry for how I made you feel, the truth is I probably would have always made you feel the way you do because I am selfish and my issues always Caine before yours. This isn’t your fault, stop blaming yourself and stop feeling like you were never good enough because you are, it was I who was never good enough for you.

Please forgive me.

## Refactoring, Rewiring

> I’ve been here before, but I haven’t been here, before. 

My whole adult life, I have cried and complained about how life dealt me a shitty hand. It turns out the dealer was mostly me. I always wanted something I couldn’t have. I was obsessed with trying to understand why I could not get what I wanted. Ignorant and wasteful. So much time and so many years spent chasing people I no longer had. It seems I put all my effort and motivation into doing things that would bring them back to me. I was never doing anything that would actually benefit me in the long term. I guess my logic was that if I do this, or I be that, I’ll get what I want. The problem was that I already had what I wanted; I just didn’t put the time and effort into keeping it. 

So I’ll say it again. 

> I’ve been here before, but I haven’t been here, before. 

The place where you have to start all over. From the bottom. Up until today, no job, no vehicle, no home, although I got lucky enough that my mom has lent me her house and vehicle while she’s gone for the year traveling the US.

I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve been here at the starting line again. The difference is that I chose to be here. I’ve always understood the concept that doing the same things over and over will always produce the same results. I just always choose to ignore it and do it anyway. 

This time, I’m not chasing anyone; I’m not trying to be someone I’m not. I don’t even know who I want to be yet, but I do know it’s not who I’ve always been. I don’t see the world as dark and depressing as I used to, but I find myself hesitant to say or use words like “feeling or being hopeful”.

10 years ago, I would always update my social media accounts with whatever progress I thought I was making. I have no desire to do that again. If I fail, I’m going to fail quietly. The road ahead is not an easy one. I know what comes around goes around, and the ghosts of my past will come to collect soon enough.
