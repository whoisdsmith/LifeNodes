Today I finally know what it feels like to be the main villain in someone else’s story. Not in an evil or deliberate way, but in the way I understand how I’ve made them feel, by tearing their heart out.

I have always preached about **NOT** turning into the people that hurt you and yet I have done just that. Face to face with my actions and the consequences someone else has to pay for. I know that I am the cause of their pain. I know that I have made them feel the same way I wish others had never made me feel. This is not something I am glorifying or trying to perceive as being ok, it is an awareness I am acknowledging and taking responsibility for.

I know now that I will never change unless I am put in a position where I have no other choice. I am deeply sorry for how I made you feel, the truth is I probably would have always made you feel the way you do because I am selfish and my issues always Caine before yours. This isn’t your fault, stop blaming yourself and stop feeling like you were never good enough because you are, it was I who was never good enough for you.

Please forgive me.
