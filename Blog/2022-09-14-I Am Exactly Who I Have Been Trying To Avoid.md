I’ve got so many things I want to say, that I have to say, I just don’t know how. I don’t know how to communicate anymore. Everyone should be able to communicate their feelings, at the very least, we should be able to transfer those feelings from thoughts to something written. I can’t even do that anymore.

So many things have changed within me over the last few months. Things that I am aware of, things that I continue to ignore. I have so many things to be grateful for and to be thankful for. I have people who love and care about me, who go above and beyond to make sure I am ok and that I have whatever I want or need.

I don’t know why anyone continues to care about me. I am so hard to love, and it seems impossible to talk to…because I never say more than a few words. I am not this way on purpose or to be hurtful. I know I have hurt and offended people by ignoring them or being short with them.

I seem to have gotten entirely too comfortable being alone or by myself. When other people are hurting and going through shit, they tend to reach out to others, to talk to, to go have some drinks with, so they can forget about whatever they’ve been feeling, even if it’s just a temporary escape.

That’s not how I processed my emotions. I cut myself off from the outside world and plugged myself into a laptop or pc. Here, in this space, I could go wherever I wanted, do whatever I wanted, and distract myself from feeling anything at all.

If anyone said or did something to hurt me, I knew how to make it go away. Go Home. Take an Adderall. Pull the chair up to the computer, and 10 minutes later. Those words or actions became non-existent, and I guess eventually, So did I.

For so long, that was my **Superpower**.

I thought,

> ”go ahead and be an asshole or a shitty person to me, I’ll give you the satisfaction of 10 minutes of initial impact, and then, you’ll be discarded from my thoughts completely, as if you never even existed.”

Somewhere down the road, that process of “**coping**” and “**healing**” just turned into habit and I continued to plug myself into my digital terminal, while discarding conversation and basic human interactions with friends and loved ones.

Those close to me often say that I “live in a bubble” or that I “live in my own little world” words and phrases, I have heard so often, that my response is usually met with a look of “whatever” or with me “rolling my eyes” at them. It wasn’t because they were right, but because I didn’t want to admit that they were right or acknowledge that even though I was present in the conversation, I wasn’t really “present”.

That’s something I have grown to understand a lot in the last few months.

That even though I am “physically” present in the current conversation, I’m never really “**present**” mentally.

I know that must be so frustrating and irritating to the ones trying to communicate with me.

There are so many issues within myself that I have ignored, simply by telling myself they didn’t exist. That’s what I do when my operating system doesn’t run like it’s supposed to.

Ignoring my issues isn’t the only thing I’ve been ignoring lately, it’s been everything and everyone. Family, friends, bills, work, life. Everything.

I’ve been going through a bad wave of depression, constantly overwhelmed with the weight of feeling like a piece of shit. I can’t shake that feeling anymore, either.

This is Everett’s last year of High School, last year of him playing football, and I’ve already missed out on 3 games because there’s so much shit I feel at the moment when it comes to him.

He’s the reason I even started writing this, because I don’t know what he thinks or feels anymore. We never got to have that father and son bond like we should have. When it comes down to it, it wasn’t anyone’s fault for that. It was just life and the cards we were dealt.

Honestly, I’ve always been caught up in negative shit, and he is the exact opposite,
which is the best thing I could ever want for him.

Where I’m at in my head right now, I just feel like the farther away I am from him, the less he will be infected or affected by my current state. That’s not what I want him, he’s never been anything like me, and for that I am grateful.

If this is what it takes to keep going in the right direction, then I will continue to watch from the sidelines, cause even though I’m not actively there, I’m still there in the background, watching and cheering him on. I couldn’t be more proud of him. He exceeds at everything I failed at.

I am stuck in a constant state of error. Realizing and understanding there is something internally wrong with me. I have read the error codes over and over. The alarms are so loud now that they won’t let me ignore them anymore. The monitors are stuck flashing “Sink or Swim” I too, feel like I am stuck, unable to get out of this debug mode.

This internal code I have run on for 37 years is my DNA nobody can decode it but me. This is not a cry for someone to help or fix me, because no matter what your level of programming or troubleshooting is, you’ll never understand my code.

This is an issue that can only be fixed and addressed by me. All I think about right now is whether I will “Sink or Swim”.
