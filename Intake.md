# Childhood

Overall I had a really good childhood growing up.

## Parents and Household

My mom raised me by herself and with my grandparents, from the time I was born until I was five years old. When she met my dad, Johnnie B. Smith back in 1990.

My mom and I moved in with him shortly after that to a house in Marshall, MI where I went to school from kindergarten until fifth grade.

Up until this point I had only seen my biological father maybe 10 times during my first five years and even when I did see him he was never there or present. In June of 1992 my mom and Dad got married and my dad asked me if he could adopt me and I had never been so excited cause he truly was the coolest and best man who had ever been in my life so far. He took me in as his own and taught me how to hunt and fish and how to defend myself and how to treat women with respect.

In 1995 we moved to Tekonsha, MI out in the country next to my grandma and grandpa.

They gave me a wonderful life. They were really good to me. They were present all the time. We took yearly vacations. They gave me time and attention and helped me build core values and beliefs and all other cores.

They came to all of my games. Once I got into high school, I got into music and was in a band.
They came to all of my shows, always supported me and my decisions no matter what I wanted to do. Never treated me unfairly and always made me feel happy and loved.

They never fought in front of each other. They loved each other deeply up until tell my sophomore year in high school. They just kind of drifted away from each other and tried to make it work until I graduated.

I was unaware of how far they had grown apart during this time because we were always still a family, always still doing things together, and they still never fought In front of me, I never heard them fight once.

## School and Behavior

I was a chaotic and challenging child too from the time I was 2 until I was 10. Always wanted what I couldn’t have and throwing fits for not getting it. I was so active and chaotic all through school. I never paid attention or followed directions and the teachers always told my mom I should be on meds. I was just being a kid I think, I can’t really see any underlying issues as to why I was so bad at times other than I grew out of it after 10 and became so much more behaved.

## Family

My mom’s family and my dad’s family were both really close families and we were all close with them as well.

## Worldview

I was never around drugs or violence or any kind of anger or abuse. I never saw things I wasn’t supposed to as a kid. My entire childhood and early adult life was a pretty loving, caring and happy place to be. So good, that it really made me blind and naive to the world outside of my family. Even all my friends and girlfriends in childhood and teenage years had caring and loving families, so I was never exposed to people who had not got that same love and care from their families.

## Teen Years

- I played sports up unit I broke my ankle in 8th grade playing football, after that I lost all interest and found my passion in music.
- I started a band in 8th grade with my 2 best friends Jake Goheen and Derek Feltner. After I graduated we got a record deal with an indie label and toured the U.S. on and off from 2004-2006.
- I had a lot of friends. I was one of those people who can be friends with anybody. At my high school graduation I had all my friends there and it was kind of split into different groups of people because not everyone liked each other the way that I liked them. That’s just who I was, care free only wanted peace and happiness.
- I never did any drugs during my teenage years except weed, one time and I absolutely hated it. I never smoked cigarettes cause I hated it. I did drink responsibly though. My mom and dad always let me have my friends over for bonfires and parties but the deal was everyone had to turn in their car keys to them and they all had to stay the night. On a scale of an average teenager I probably drank slightly under cause it was never that much fun.
- I got my first job when I was 13 over the summer Detasseling corn. I did this till I was 15. After that I worked at Wendy’s until right after graduation.
- I got my first girlfriend Amanda Hoag in 7th grade to 8th grade and she moved away.
- My first real relationship came in 2001 when I was 16 and I met Rebecca Rewa at a rock show I was playing at in Marshall. She became the center of my world until December of 2006. We had our first child Everett Tyler Lee Smith on July 26, 2005. I was 19 and she was 17 and just graduated high school.

## Adulthood

- got my first apartment with Rebecca and Everett in April of 2006

# Side Notes

In the past I tended to fall back to my last relationship as a coping mechanism to get over the current one. I don't mean that I got back with the person in my last relationship, I'm talking about in my mind fantasizing and reminiscing on past times. It seemed to always help the ache in my stomach when dealing with the present heartbreak.
