# Childhood

Overall I had a really good childhood growing up.

## Parents and Household

My mom raised me by herself and with my grandparents, from the time I was born until I was five years old. When she met my dad, Johnnie B. Smith back in 1990.

My mom and I moved in with him shortly after that to a house in Marshall, MI where I went to school from kindergarten until fifth grade.

Up until this point I had only seen my biological father maybe 10 times during my first five years and even when I did see him he was never there or present. In June of 1992 my mom and Dad got married and my dad asked me if he could adopt me and I had never been so excited cause he truly was the coolest and best man who had ever been in my life so far. He took me in as his own and taught me how to hunt and fish and how to defend myself and how to treat women with respect.

In 1995 we moved to Tekonsha, MI out in the country next to my grandma and grandpa.

They gave me a wonderful life. They were really good to me. They were present all the time. We took yearly vacations. They gave me time and attention and helped me build core values and beliefs and all other cores.

They came to all of my games. Once I got into high school, I got into music and was in a band.
They came to all of my shows, always supported me and my decisions no matter what I wanted to do. Never treated me unfairly and always made me feel happy and loved.

They never fought in front of each other. They loved each other deeply up until tell my sophomore year in high school. They just kind of drifted away from each other and tried to make it work until I graduated.

I was unaware of how far they had grown apart during this time because we were always still a family, always still doing things together, and they still never fought In front of me, I never heard them fight once.

## School and Behavior

I was a chaotic and challenging child too from the time I was 2 until I was 10. Always wanted what I couldn’t have and throwing fits for not getting it. I was so active and chaotic all through school. I never paid attention or followed directions and the teachers always told my mom I should be on meds. I was just being a kid I think, I can’t really see any underlying issues as to why I was so bad at times other than I grew out of it after 10 and became so much more behaved.

## Family

My mom’s family and my dad’s family were both really close families and we were all close with them as well.

## Worldview

I was never around drugs or violence or any kind of anger or abuse. I never saw things I wasn’t supposed to as a kid. My entire childhood and early adult life was a pretty loving, caring and happy place to be. So good, that it really made me blind and naive to the world outside of my family. Even all my friends and girlfriends in childhood and teenage years had caring and loving families, so I was never exposed to people who had not got that same love and care from their families.

## Teen Years

- I played sports up unit I broke my ankle in 8th grade playing football, after that I lost all interest and found my passion in music.
- I started a band in 8th grade with my 2 best friends Jake Goheen and Derek Feltner. After I graduated we got a record deal with an indie label and toured the U.S. on and off from 2004-2006.
- I had a lot of friends. I was one of those people who can be friends with anybody. At my high school graduation I had all my friends there and it was kind of split into different groups of people because not everyone liked each other the way that I liked them. That’s just who I was, care free only wanted peace and happiness.
- I never did any drugs during my teenage years except weed, one time and I absolutely hated it. I never smoked cigarettes cause I hated it. I did drink responsibly though. My mom and dad always let me have my friends over for bonfires and parties but the deal was everyone had to turn in their car keys to them and they all had to stay the night. On a scale of an average teenager I probably drank slightly under cause it was never that much fun.
- I got my first job when I was 13 over the summer Detasseling corn. I did this till I was 15. After that I worked at Wendy’s until right after graduation.
- I got my first girlfriend Amanda Hoag in 7th grade to 8th grade and she moved away.
- My first real relationship came in 2001 when I was 16 and I met Rebecca Rewa at a rock show I was playing at in Marshall. She became the center of my world until December of 2006. We had our first child Everett Tyler Lee Smith on July 26, 2005. I was 19 and she was 17 and just graduated high school.

## Adulthood

- got my first apartment with Rebecca and Everett in April of 2006

### Childhood and Teen Years

I had a really good childhood overall, marked by stability and strong familial bonds. My mom raised me by herself and with my grandparents until I was five, when she met my stepfather, Johnnie B. Smith. Moving in with Johnnie in 1990 was a significant turning point. He adopted me in 1992, becoming the coolest and best man in my life, teaching me valuable life skills and treating me as his own. Despite being a chaotic and challenging child, my family always supported me, attending all my games and shows and fostering a nurturing environment that shaped my core values and beliefs.

During my teen years, I shifted my focus from sports to music after breaking my ankle in eighth grade. I started a band with my best friends, and my social circle became diverse, reflecting my ability to connect with different groups. I held various jobs from a young age, demonstrating a strong work ethic. My first significant relationship began in 2001 with Rebecca Rewa, and we had our son Everett in 2005, when I was 19.

### Early Adulthood

#### 2006-2009

In early adulthood, my life was a mix of personal and professional changes. In April 2006, I moved into my first apartment with Rebecca and Everett. However, our relationship ended in December 2006. Following the breakup, I faced a turbulent period, moving multiple times and dealing with the challenges of single parenthood.

A brief but intense relationship with Emily Duty in 2009 ended in heartbreak, further complicating my emotional landscape. This period also saw me juggling jobs and pursuing higher education, showing resilience despite the adversities.

#### 2010-2013

The next phase of my life was marked by significant milestones and tragedies. I began a relationship with Stevie Linnabary in November 2011, leading to our engagement in 2012. However, we faced the devastating loss of our baby boy, Jensen, in September 2012, and my father suffered a heart attack the same year. These events profoundly impacted me, resulting in job loss and emotional turmoil.

In April 2014, Stevie and I welcomed our daughter Lydia, adding joy to our lives amidst ongoing struggles. Despite financial stress and personal challenges, I sought therapy and started a new job in October 2014, showcasing my commitment to personal and professional growth.

#### 2014-2017

This period was marked by further highs and lows. In 2015, I left my job at Autocam Corporation and started working at Jorgensen Steel Machining & Fabricating Inc. In June 2016, our second daughter, Rayna, was born. However, financial difficulties forced us to move in with my mother temporarily. Our relationship continued to deteriorate, culminating in Stevie's affair and our subsequent separation in April 2017. This tumultuous period saw me grappling with depression and the complexities of co-parenting.

#### 2018-2020

The aftermath of the divorce was challenging. I moved through various jobs, from forklift driving to working at a gas station, while dealing with depression and the complexities of co-parenting. In 2020, I started a new relationship with Tawnie Nicole Reynolds and found pride in my work in the solar industry, reflecting a period of personal growth and overcoming past hardships.

#### 2021-2024

The loss of my father in 2021 was a significant blow. I navigated through job changes, working in AI and Machine Learning, and continued to build my relationship with Tawnie. Despite these efforts, our relationship ended in February 2024. I began working at Knauf Insulation in April 2024, showing my resilience and commitment to moving forward despite personal setbacks.

### Summary

My life is a testament to resilience and capacity for growth. From a supportive and nurturing childhood to navigating the complexities of adulthood, I have consistently demonstrated strength and adaptability. Despite facing significant personal and professional challenges, I continue to strive for stability and personal growth, making the best of each situation while cherishing my role as a father and partner.
