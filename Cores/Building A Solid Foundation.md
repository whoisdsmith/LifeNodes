## In Love

- Communication Is The Number One Key To A Successful Relationship.
- Always Be Honest, No Matter What's At Stake.
- Be Present, Both Mentally And Physically.
- Understand yourself and learn to understand how your significant other Communicates.
- Without Communication there is no Relationship. Period.
- Always Be Honest.
- If you do or say something bad, own that shit and apologize.
- When you lie, your relationship will bleed and so will the person you lied to.
- Understand YOUR Needs and the things YOU value.
- It’s just important to understand THEIR needs and what they value as well.
- Every Relationship is different because every single person is different.
- What happened in your previous relationships have no place in your current one.
- Just because you were lied to, cheated on or neglected before doesn’t mean the same thing will happen with this new person. If you go into a new relationship with that mindset, you are metaphorically holding a gun to the head of this new person and have condemned the relationship to fail right from the beginning.
- Every person has baggage and wounds from someone else, it is your responsibility to be open and understanding to why people feel the way they feel and to talk about it in ways that helps your relationship.
- When people have been hurt, they don’t always like to talk about it. Opening up is hard and even harder when it’s to someone new and someone you have feelings for. This might be because they don’t want to feel embarrassed or stupid or judged or vulnerable.
- Be patient and be understanding.
- Take the time to heal from your heartbreaks
- This really should be #1 on this subject because people don’t understand that you can’t just jump into a new relationship right after your previous one fails.
- You have to heal your wounds. You have to understand why the relationship ended. You have to feel that pain and those aches in your stomach to the full extent.
- DO NOT run from that pain. Face it and find acceptance and closure before moving on.

## Core Beliefs

- It's never too late to change, it's never too late to outgrow the people who don't bring the same positive energy as you do and that includes family.
    - You might be connected by blood but there are people out there who are bonded to you by real love, people who will go to war and fight your demons with you. Instead of using them to hurt you.
- There are people who won't abandon you when you feel like giving up.
    - People who continue to show up even when it's inconvenient.
    - People who don't want anything from you but your company.
- Let sadness run its course,
	- This is your one time to grieve & feel sorry for yourself.
	- Do not let sadness stay, it must be allowed to visit, but you must never build a house for it.

- Stop living like tomorrow never comes and start living to build a future.
- Slow down and live in the moment.
- Stop chasing the people who moved on from your life.
- Stop wasting time on people who make excuses or ignore you.
- Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
- Stop wasting time on things that don’t matter, especially when the things that do matter are right in front of you. Your friends, your lover, your children, all of the people who want nothing but your attention. The more you ignore and neglect those people, the less they will want anything from you.
- Losing and failing doesn't make you a failure. Quitting does.
- Hold yourself accountable and take responsibility for your actions.
- Understand who you are, what you want and what you believe in, before you try to understand anyone else.
- You can’t fix people, you can only try and guide them.
- All you can be is who you are. Nothing more, nothing less.

# Heart of Gold

In life we make mistakes, we fuck up and than we fuck up some more. What’s important is that we learn from those mistakes and correct our actions and behavior because of those mistakes.

You’re going to have good days and you’re going to have bad days, really bad days and “it’s the end of the world” bad days. The good news is, those days don’t last long and they don’t come around often or at least they shouldn’t.

Life is about living and dreaming and finding out who you are. Do your best to be open minded and kind and caring. Things are going to happen to you that will not be your fault, things that will be out of your control and things that will make you feel shit you never knew existed. Don’t let those things or those people turn your hearts of gold into stone. Don’t become the things that hurt you.

## Navigating Light and Darkness: Principles of Forgiveness and the Unforgivable

These are the principles for which I built my entire life upon.

- Being a good person, doing what’s right for myself and for others.
- Caring deeply and treating people with respect.
- Forgiveness and moving forward.
- Choosing love over hate.
- Choosing to walk away instead of fighting.

I always believed that no matter what someone has done to you, time will heal you and give you acceptance.

But sometimes, something so awful happens to you ,that you can’t even process or make sense of it. Sometimes, lines get crossed that you never even knew were there.

I still believe in doing the right thing but now realize that there are rare exceptions in which you cannot forgive someone. You cannot just turn your back and continue forward, without looking weak, without giving off the impression, that what they did to you, was ok.

Some things are not ok and I see now that some people think they can do and take what they want without any consequence or remorse.

Sometimes people cut you so deep that you never stop bleeding

Some people feed off the joy of hurting people

These people become unstoppable, almost invincible as if nothing bad happens to them because they are the bad things to everyone else

I have this inner light that can illuminate the the world around me, and around those near me. I’ve always chosen corrective action over conflict but this time I could not see a path lit in front of me by the light. As much as that light in me is good I carry that same amount of fire in me that is darkness. I am heaven and I am hell, both trapped in the same vessel.

## The Truth Is

- You never really heal from certain traumas.
	- They become a part of you forever.
- The only hope is that you don't become the people that hurt you.
	- It's not fair that they did what they did to you, but it's more unfair that you cause someone else the same trauma, just because it was done to you.
- Know the difference.
	- Break the cycle or the cycle keeps repeating.
		- Year after year,
			- Generation to generation.
