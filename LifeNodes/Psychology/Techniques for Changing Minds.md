### Caveat

Just a note of gentle caution: the word 'technique' sometimes implies some kind of magic, with the implicit promise that 'if you do this you will get that'. There is no magic and the techniques here are things that if you do, you _may_ get something of what you want. Technique is not a substitute for thinking, so do try to understand how things work rather than just blindly applying techniques (then blaming them when they don't work). Life is a numbers game: there are no guarantees. Life is also about practice -- the more you try, the better you will get, so if things do not work for you this time, then keep trying and keep trying different things. Also see the slightly longer [Caveat](../and/caveat.htm).
