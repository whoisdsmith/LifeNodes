# Persuasion Principles

## Persuasion Principles

Much of persuasion and other forms of changing minds is based on a relatively small number of principles. If you can understand the principles, then you can invent your own techniques. It thus makes sense to spend time to understand these principles (persuaded yet?).

* [Alignment](alignment.htm): When everything lines up, there are no contradictions to cause disagreement.
* [Amplification](amplification.htm): Make the important bits bigger and other bits smaller.
* [Appeal](appeal.htm): If asked nicely, we will follow the rules we have made for ourselves.
* [Arousal](arousal.htm): When I am aroused I am full engaged and hence more likely to pay attention.
* [Association](association.htm): Our thoughts are connected. Think one thing and the next is automatic.
* [Assumption](assumption.htm): Acting as if something is true often makes it true.
* [Attention](attention.htm): Make sure they are listening before you try to sell them something.
